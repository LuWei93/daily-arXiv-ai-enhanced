This paper develops a unified categorical framework that\nencompasses these models and their interrelations using the language of double\ncategories. We introduce double port graphs, a bidirectional generalization of\nport graphs, to represent the quantum (horizontal) and classical (vertical)\nflows of information within computational architectures. Quantum operations are\ndescribed as adaptive instruments, organized into a one-object double category\nwhose horizontal and vertical directions correspond to quantum channels and\nstochastic maps, respectively. Within this setting, we capture prominent\nadaptive quantum computation models, including measurement-based and\nmagic-state models. To analyze computational power, we extend the theory of\ncontextuality to an adaptive setting through the notion of simplicial\ninstruments, which generalize simplicial distributions to double categorical\nform. This construction yields a quantitative characterization of computational\npower in terms of contextual fraction, leading to a categorical formulation of\nthe result that non-contextual resources can compute only affine Boolean\nfunctions.

Because each round of QEC depends on measurement,\nlong readout times increase cycle duration and slow down program execution.\nReducing the readout duration speeds up cycles and reduces decoherence errors\nthat accumulate while qubits idle, but it also lowers the number of collected\nphotons, making measurements noisier and more error-prone. This tradeoff leaves\nneutral atom systems stuck between slow but accurate readout and fast but\nunreliable readout.\n  We show that image denoising can resolve this tension.

This\nlimitation is partly overcome by coupling the device to its input/output\ntransmission line via a bandpass filter, leading to wider bandwidth at\nundiminished gain. Here we perform a non-perturbative circuit analysis in terms\nof dressed transmission-line modes for representative resonant coupling\ncircuits, going beyond the weak-coupling treatment. The strong frequency\ndependence of the resulting coupling coefficients implies that the Markov\napproximation commonly employed in cQED analysis is inadequate. By retaining\nthe full frequency dependence of the coupling, we arrive at a non-Markovian\nform of the quantum Langevin equation with the frequency-dependent\ncomplex-valued self-energy of the coupling in place of a single damping\nparameter. We also consistently generalize the input-output relations and\nunitarity conditions. Using the exact self-energies of elementary filter\nnetworks -- a series- and parallel-LC circuit and a simple representative\nbandpass filter consisting of their combination -- we calculate the generalized\nparametric gain factors. Compared with their Markovian counterpart, these gain\nprofiles are strongly modified. We find bandwidth broadening not only in the\nestablished parameter regime, where the self-energy of the coupling is in\nresonance with the device and its real part has unity slope, but also within\noff-resonant parameter regimes where the real part of the self-energy is large.\nOur results offer insight for the bandwidth engineering of Josephson parametric\ndevices using simple coupling networks."}

One way to enforce non-communication is\nto apply a latency constraint: the parties must all produce outputs after they\nreceive their inputs within a time window shorter than the speed of light delay\nbetween any pair of parties. If this latency constraint is relaxed so that a\nsubset of the parties can communicate, we can obtain a new set of inequalities\non correlations that extends Bell inequalities in a very natural way. Moreover,\nwith this relaxed latency constraint, we can also have quantum communication\nbetween a subset of parties and thereby achieve possible quantum violations of\nthese new inequalities. We ultimately wish to answer the fundamental question:\n\"What are the physically realizable correlations between multiple parties under\nvarying latency constraints?\" To answer this question, we introduce\nlatency-constrained games, a mathematical framework that extends nonlocal games\nto the setting where a subset of parties can communicate.
