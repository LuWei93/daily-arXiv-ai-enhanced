Here we develop a numerically-exact two-body description of Kapitza-Dirac scattering for two contact-interacting atoms in a one-dimensional harmonic trap subjected to a pulsed optical lattice, enabling us to obtain the numerically exact dynamics. We map how interaction strength, lattice depth, lattice wavenumber, and pulse duration reshape the diffraction pattern, leading to an interaction-dependent population redistribution in real and momentum-space. By comparing the exact dynamics to an impulsive sudden-approximation description, we delineate the parameter regimes where it remains accurate and those, notably at strong attraction and small lattice wavenumber, where it fails. Our results provide a controlled few-body benchmark for interacting Kapitza-Dirac scattering and quantitative guidance for Kapitza-Dirac-based probes of ultracold atomic systems."}

Recently, the quantum Mpemba effect (QME), a counterintuitive relaxation phenomenon, has attracted considerable attention and has been extensively studied in systems with global symmetries. Here, we study the QME in gauge theories with massive local gauge symmetries. In the lattice Schwinger model, we demonstrate that the gauge structure of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem is entirely determined by the initial state and remain unchanged during the time evolution. We then investigate whether gauge symmetry can be dynamically restored following a symmetric quench. Analytical and numerical results show that when the Maxwell term is zero, gauge symmetry restoration fails due to the emergence of a peculiar conservation law. However, for any finite Maxwell term, subsystem gauge symmetry is restored in the thermodynamic limit. Based on these results, we systematically construct a families of initial states exhibiting the QME. We further explore the QME in the quantum link model-a truncated lattice Schwinger model, which has been realized in experiments. Moreover, we propose an experimentally accessible order parameter that correctly captures the QME. Our work demonstrates the generality of the quantum Mpemba effect even in the local gauge symmetries, and are directly relevant to ongoing quantum simulation experiments of gauge theories."}

Despite the attractive self-interaction, which is necessary for producing the bullets (bright solitons), and which readily leads to the collapse in the 3D setting as well as to spontaneous splitting of vortex modes, we find a critical value of the trapping depth securing the stabilization of the vortex bullets. We identify experimental conditions for the creation of these topological modes in the context of coherent optical and matter waves. Collisions between the bullets moving in the unconfined direction are found to be elastic. These findings contribute to the understanding of self-trapping in nonlinear multidimensional systems and suggest new possibilities for the stabilization and control of 3D topological solitons."}

The MoS$_2$ is illuminated by a femtosecond laser, while a tunable near-infrared (NIR) continuous-wave laser probes the microresonator resonance. The NIR light polarization can be adjusted to either transverse electric (TE, parallel to the 2D material) or transverse magnetic (TM, perpendicular), a configuration that is impossible to achieve with conventional normal-incidence pump-probe techniques. By capturing the transmitted signal on a fast oscilloscope, we detect transient optical shifts with unprecedented sensitivity, observing phenomena over time scales ranging from picoseconds to microseconds. Our results reveal both a rapid, carrier-induced nonlinear optical shift in the resonance, and a slower thermo-optic transient. The ability to simultaneously measure these fast and slow dynamics offers new insight into the complex optoelectronic behavior of 2D materials when integrated with microresonators. This method provides a significant advance over traditional pump-probe approaches, enabling the detection of exceedingly small transient signals and opening new avenues for exploring the optical properties of atomically thin materials.

Recently, the first room-temperature spintronic Poisson bolometer based on magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) was proposed and demonstrated as a promising infrared detector. Unlike conventional bolometers, the spintronic Poisson bolometer operates in a probabilistic regime dominated by Poissonian noise, where the response is governed by resistance fluctuations arising from thermally activated magnetization transitions. Spontaneous transitions between two metastable magnetic states occur even in the absence of incident light, and the transition probability increases under illumination. In this work, we experimentally study the statistical properties of the optical response of the spintronic Poisson bolometer under illumination. We demonstrate that transitions in spintronic Poisson bolometers, both in the absence and presence of light, exhibit Poissonian behavior, with transition rates and interarrival times modulated by incident radiation. Under illumination, we observe a 153% increase in the count rate accompanied by a 70% reduction in interarrival time. These results establish spintronic Poisson bolometers as a promising platform for probabilistic, high-speed, and high-sensitivity infrared detection at room temperature."}

While the theoretical quantum speed-up from T_cl=2^{57.8} (classical) to T_qu = 2^{28.9} (quantum) is mathematically sound, the practical implementation overhead is so extreme that attacks remain wholly infeasible in both resource and runtime dimensions. Using Qiskit-based circuit synthesis, we derive that a 3-round Keccak quantum oracle requires: 9,600 Toffoli gates (with uncomputation for reversibility); 3,200 logical qubits (1,600 state + 1,600 auxiliary); 7.47 * 10^{13} total 2-qubit gates (full Grover search); 3.2 million physical qubits (with quantum error correction)PROHIBITIVE; 0.12 years (43 days) to 2,365+ years execution time, depending on machine assumptions. These barriers -- particularly the physical qubit requirements, circuit depth, and error accumulation -- render the quantum attack infeasible for any foreseeable quantum computer. Consequently, SHA-3 security is not threatened by quantum computers for preimage attacks. We emphasize the critical importance of hardware-aware complexity analysis in quantum cryptanalysis: the elegant asymptotic theory of Grover's Algorithm hides an engineering overhead so prohibitive that the quantum approach becomes infeasible from both resource and implementation perspectives."}

In photonic crystals, NHPG and the NHSE have previously been explored mainly through material loss, where the typically low $Q$ factors make direct observation of complex frequencies challenging. Here, we demonstrate the direct experimental observation of an NHPG by using a radiation-loss-based non-Hermitian photonic crystal. Radiation loss can be engineered through structural design, enabling control of the imaginary part of the complex frequency and allowing relatively high $Q$ factors. This approach is compatible with widely used absorption-free silicon-slab photonic crystals. We developed a measurement system that can measure photonic bands along arbitrary lines in $k$-space. Our measurements demonstrated direct observation of the NHPG in photonic crystals, and the reversal of non-Hermitian topology through the flip of loop rotation in a complex plane. Our platform, which requires neither gain media nor synthetic dimensions, establishes radiation-loss engineering as a simple and versatile route for photonic functionality using an NHSE in nanophotonic systems."}

Beyond the common statement that Rayleigh scattering is the primary mechanism behind the multiple colored appearances of the sky, it appears that the relationship between material parameters and the colors that appear in different observation conditions has not been thoroughly explored so far. The present study aims to offer a general overview of the structural colors accessible by Rayleigh scattering as a function of the material parameters, alongside a scalable and environment-friendly process to realize solid composite materials with targeted structural colors in reflection and transmission. Monte Carlo light transport simulations are performed to compute the structural color palette of disordered colloids -- dielectric particles in a nonscattering matrix -- in different observation modes. In particular, we provide a range of physical parameters in which the materials exhibit the same blue color in diffuse reflection and transmission. We also show that, as may be counterintuitive at first, the addition of black absorbents to the matrix of a white (opaque) material can lead to the emergence of a blue coloration in diffuse reflection, thanks to the interplay between multiple light scattering and light absorption. These predictions are validated by optical experiments on colloidal suspensions of Yttria-stabilized Zirconia (ZrO$_2$:Y$_2$O$_3$) nanoparticles in aqueous solutions. The potential of Rayleigh-scattering materials for visual arts and design is further supported by realizing solid-state composites based on abundant materials, namely borosilicate clays and hybrid silica-based glasses, using soft chemistry at room temperature."}

Given this property, can one use the amount to which a state is unchanged by the stabilizers as a proxy for the quality of a GKP state? This is shown to hold in the opposite manner to which it is routinely assumed, because in fact the fidelity a state has to an ideal GKP state is only upper bounded by the stabilizer expectation values. This means that, for qubits encoded in harmonic oscillators via the GKP code, a good stabilizer expectation value does not guarantee proximity to an ideal GKP state in terms of any distance based on fidelity."}

Here, we show that a non-entangling operation can increase the Schmidt number of a quantum state only if it can generate entanglement with some non-zero probability. This is in stark contrast to the case where the parties of a quantum network are only able to control their joint state by local operations and classical communication (LOCC). There, being able to apply operations probabilistically (stochastic LOCC) does not increase the Schmidt number. Our findings show that certain non-entangling operations become entangling when selecting on specific measurement outcomes. This naturally leads us to the class of stochastically non-entangling maps, being those that cannot generate entanglement even probabilistically. Intrigued by this finding, we devise a Schmidt number for quantum channels that quantifies whether a channel can generate entanglement probabilistically. Moreover, we show that a channel is non-entangling if and only if its dual map is witness-preserving -- it takes entanglement witnesses to witnesses. Based on this finding, we derive Bell-like inequalities whose violation signals that a process generates entanglement."}

To benchmark the measurements, we performed detailed theoretical calculation of the orientation-dependent harmonic yields.

Current methods of fabricating devices in polariton microcavities largely involve patterning the devices via e-beam lithography before the cavity is completed, which offers less flexibility in device creation and reduces the maximum possible refractive index contrast. Moreover, the momentum and spatial distributions of the condensate are highly dependent on the host platform, and it has been difficult to preserve the desired behavior when modifying a given cavity. Here we introduce a method that addresses both of these challenges with the creation of polaritonic circuits of arbitrary forms etched via Focused Ion Beam into an organic microcavity based on Rhodamine 3B Perchlorate within a Small Molecule Ionic Isolation Lattices complex. We demonstrate room temperature condensation and propagation of polaritons in rectangular and trapezoidal waveguides by analyzing spatial and angle-resolved photoluminescence. We also discuss the blue-shifting and non-zero momentum of the condensate and show that it is strongly confined up to several higher energy levels. As an example, we report the spatial profiles of condensation in custom devices, such as a ring waveguide, a Y-splitter, and a Mach-Zehnder interferometer.

We find a rich phase diagram: in one spatial dimension, charge is always easy to learn, while dipole moment can be either easy or hard. In two dimensions, we find three phases: for frequent measurements, both charge and dipole moment are easy to learn; as the measurement rate is decreased, first dipole moment and then charge become hard. In two dimensions, the low-measurement phase is an exotic critical phase with anisotropic spacetime scaling, analogous to a smectic liquid crystal."}

Here, we approach the problem using convex geometry, reducing the question to the characterization of the extreme points of the set of WPS. We give a constructive method to generate a large class of such extreme WPS, which combines the following steps: (i) we characterize the phase-invariant extreme points of the superset of Wigner-positive quasi-states (WPQS); (ii) we introduce a new quantum map, named Vertigo map, which maps extreme WPQS to extreme WPS while preserving phase invariance; (iii) we identify families of extremality-preserving maps and use them to obtain extreme WPS while relaxing phase invariance. Our construction generates all extreme WPS of low dimension, starting from a specific kind of WPS known as beam-splitter states.

We show that this does not have to be the case: under restricted operational access, classical correlations can appear nonseparable when expressed in the formalism of quantum mechanics. If an observer is limited to a constrained set of measurements and transformations, certain classical phase-space distributions can mimic entanglement-like behaviours. Imposing positivity of the associated Hilbert space operator as a physicality requirement removes some of these representational artifacts, revealing a regime in which nonseparability is genuine but still reproducible by classical models. Only when the operational restrictions on the observer are lifted further--allowing operational tests of measurement incompatibility or other nonclassical signatures--does one obtain entanglement that can no longer be captured by any classical description. This operational hierarchy distinguishes classical artifacts, classically reproducible nonseparability, and genuine entanglement."}

In this study, we investigate a hyperspectral dataset composed of 150 spectral bands with soil moisture as the target variable. To address the curse of dimensionality, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed as a baseline dimensionality reduction technique. The optimal number of principal components was determined to be two, retaining more than 99% of the total variance. This selection was supported by the analysis of the covariance matrix, eigenvalue distribution, and the scree plot. Projecting the data onto the first two principal components enabled improved visualization and interpretability compared to the original high-dimensional feature space. The reduced representation also revealed a clearer separation of target values, effectively decreasing data complexity. To evaluate the impact of dimensionality reduction on predictive performance, a Random Forest regression model was trained to estimate soil moisture from the PCA-transformed data.

We demonstrate this behavior using classical and quantum simulations with Haar-random and phase-flip noise, respectively, on a spin-1/2 chain with a local Hamiltonian. Our non-integrable model sees ~3.5x faster thermalization in the presence of noise, while our integrable model, which would not otherwise thermalize, reaches a thermal state due to noise. Since certifying a local Gibbs state is relatively easy on a quantum computer, our approach provides a new practical solution to a key problem in quantum computing. More broadly, these results establish a new paradigm in which noise can be harnessed on quantum computers, enabling practical advantages before the years of fault-tolerance."}

By bridging classical electrodynamics description for quasi-normal modes (retardation effects included) with a quantum emitter perspective, this framework provides an analytically tractable description of the damping of the dissipative confined plasmonic systems. In addition to its significance for emission control, the model emphasizes the bosonic characteristics of plasmonic quasi-particles, which are coherent many-electron excitations of the states of quasi-normal modes. Unlike conventional cavity quantum electrodynamics (CQED), where the emitter and cavity exist as separate systems, a plasmonic quasi-particle functions as a quantum emitter embedded within a self-created resonant near-field nano-cavity of confined radial fields, sharing the spectral characteristics of the surface transverse-magnetic (TM) modes, which include nonradiative damping effects resulting from, e.g., ohmic losses in a metal. This work extends Fermi's Golden Rule to include the coupling between the emission process and the self-generated cavity impact.

Recent advancements in voltage-sensitive dyes and, particularly, genetically encoded voltage indicators have significantly enhanced the feasibility of voltage imaging, prompting the development of advanced fluorescence microscopy methods optimized for high-speed acquisition. However, achieving millisecond-scale temporal resolution remains challenging due to inherent trade-offs among imaging speed, spatial resolution, and signal-to-noise ratio.

For solving the inverse problem of designing new metasurfaces that transform EM fields in a desirable manner, it is often necessary to explore large design spaces through full-wave simulations that can be computationally demanding. In this work, we demonstrate that neural operators, which are artificial neural network architectures designed to learn operators between function spaces, can effectively approximate the differential operators underlying Maxwell's equations, enabling their use as fast and accurate 3D surrogate models that can predict 3D EM fields transformed by metasurfaces. To calibrate neural operators, we generate synthetic training data consisting of 3D metasurface geometries together with their associated 3D EM fields obtained by numerically solving Maxwell's equations. Using the generated synthetic data, we train physics-informed neural operators to minimize physical inconsistencies of predicted EM fields by incorporating residuals that capture deviations from Maxwell's equations. We observe that a training dataset consisting of fewer than 5000 examples already suffices to achieve reasonable results. In particular, our experiments show that the resulting 3D surrogate model achieves high predictive performance across a wide range of metasurface geometries, including types of structures not encountered during training. Notably, it predicts diffraction efficiencies with relative errors of 3.9 % and provides a 67-fold speedup compared to conventional 3D simulations. Overall, once trained, our 3D surrogate model can rapidly predict EM fields for previously unseen metasurface geometries, which can facilitate efficient gradient-based design of nanostructured materials for EM wave control."}

In the context of multistate Landau-Zener models -- $N$-state quantum systems with linearly time-dependent Hamiltonians -- the theory of integrability provides a framework for identifying new solvable cases. In particular, it was proved that the integrability of a specific class known as the multitime Landau-Zener (MTLZ) models guarantees their exact solvability. A key finding was that an $N$-state MTLZ model can be represented by data defined on an $N$-vertex graph. While known host graphs for MTLZ models include hypercubes, fans, and their Cartesian products, no other families have been discovered, leading to the conjecture that these are the only possibilities. In this work, we conduct a systematic graph-theoretical search for integrable models within the MTLZ class. By first identifying minimal structures that a graph must contain to host an MTLZ model, we formulate an efficient algorithm to systematically search for candidate graphs for MTLZ models. Implementing this algorithm using computational software, we enumerate all candidate graphs with up to $N = 13$ vertices and perform an in-depth analysis of those with $N \\le 11$. Our results corroborate the aforementioned conjecture for graphs up to $11$ vertices. For even larger graphs, we propose a specific family, termed descendants of ``$(0,2)$-graphs'', as promising candidates that may violate the conjecture above.

Despite many theoretical models, decoherence remains a severe challenge and practical platforms are still rare. Here we propose the QB based on the degenerate optical parametric oscillator (DOPO), using the signal field as the energy-storage unit. We carefully separate the ergotropy into coherent and incoherent components and find that the coherent part decays roughly half as slowly as the incoherent part. More importantly, the coherent ergotropy and the average charging power reach their respective maxima at essentially the same moment, i.e., $γ_s t \\approx 10$.

Here, we demonstrate an on-chip multimode resonator in which strong parametric modulation induces a large and tunable normal-mode splitting that enables microwave storage. When the spectral bandwidth of a short microwave pulse covers the two dressed-state absorption peaks, part of the pulse is absorbed and undergoes coherent energy exchange between the modes, producing a clear time-domain beating signal. By switching off the modulation before the beating arrives, we realize on-demand storage and retrieval, demonstrating an alternative approach to microwave photonic quantum memory. This parametric-normal-mode-splitting protocol offers a practical route toward a controllable quantum-memory mechanism in superconducting circuits."}

One limitation of the algorithm is that it requires knowledge of the number of solutions to obtain an optimal success probability, due to the oscillatory dynamics between the initial and solutions states (the ``soufflé problem''). While various methods have been proposed to solve this problem, each has their drawbacks in terms of inefficiency or sensitivity to control errors. Here, we modify Grover's algorithm to eliminate the oscillatory dynamics, such that the search proceeds as an exponential decay into the solution states. The basic idea is to convert the solution states into a reservoir by using ancilla qubits such that the initial state is nonreflectively absorbed. Trotterizing the continuous algorithm yields a quantum circuit that gives equivalent performance, which has the same quadratic quantum speedup as the original algorithm."}

Recently, the quantum Mpemba effect (QME), a counterintuitive relaxation phenomenon, has attracted considerable attention and has been extensively studied in systems with global symmetries. Here, we study the QME in gauge theories with massive local gauge symmetries. In the lattice Schwinger model, we demonstrate that the gauge structure of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem is entirely determined by the initial state and remain unchanged during the time evolution. We then investigate whether gauge symmetry can be dynamically restored following a symmetric quench. Analytical and numerical results show that when the Maxwell term is zero, gauge symmetry restoration fails due to the emergence of a peculiar conservation law. However, for any finite Maxwell term, subsystem gauge symmetry is restored in the thermodynamic limit. Based on these results, we systematically construct a families of initial states exhibiting the QME. We further explore the QME in the quantum link model-a truncated lattice Schwinger model, which has been realized in experiments. Moreover, we propose an experimentally accessible order parameter that correctly captures the QME. Our work demonstrates the generality of the quantum Mpemba effect even in the local gauge symmetries, and are directly relevant to ongoing quantum simulation experiments of gauge theories."}

SI: 5 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "Molecular spin qudits based on lanthanide complexes offer a promising platform for quantum technologies, combining chemical tunability with multi-level encoding. However, experimental demonstrations of their envisaged capabilities remain scarce, posing the difficulty of achieving precise control over coherences between qudit states in long pulse sequences. Here, we implement in 173Yb(trensal) qudit the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), a core component of numerous quantum algorithms, storing quantum information in the phases of coherences. QFT provides an ideal benchmark for coherence manipulation and an unprecedented challenge for molecular spin qudits. We address this challenge by embedding a full-refocusing protocol for spin qudits in our algorithm, mitigating inhomogeneous broadening and enabling a high-fidelity recovery of the state. Complete state tomography demostrates the performance of the algorithm, while simulations provide insight into the physical mechanisms behind inhomogeneous broadening. This work shows the feasibility of quantum logic on molecular spin qudits and highlights their potential."}

Among them, generalized coherent states (GCS), which naturally arise from the evolution of a coherent state with a nonlinear medium, exhibit useful quantum features such as Wigner negativity and metrological advantages [Phys. Rev. Res. 5, 013165 (2023)]. Because these states remain coherent to all orders, their nonclassical character cannot be revealed through standard intensity-intensity correlation measurements. Here, we demonstrate that the intensity-field correlation function alone provides a simple and experimentally accessible witness of nonclassicality. For GCSs, any deviation of this normalized correlation from unity signals nonclassical behavior. We derive analytical results for Kerr-generated states and extend the analysis to statistical mixtures of GCSs. The proposed approach enables real-time, low-complexity detection of quantum signatures in non-Gaussian states, offering a practical tool for experiments across a broad range of nonlinear regimes."}

Here we show that this gap disappears in a minimal broadcast extension of the Bell scenario. Assuming only the validity of quantum theory, we prove that for every entangled state $ρ_{AB}$ there exist local broadcasting maps and local measurements such that the resulting four--partite correlations cannot be reproduced by any broadcast network whose source is separable across the $A|B$ cut. Thus, all entangled states are broadcast nonlocal in quantum theory. In addition, we show that all (also mixed) multipartite states can be broadcast-self-tested, according to a natural operational definition."}

To bring clarity to this search, we introduce a framework that connects the structure of parametrized quantum circuits to the mathematical nature of the functions they can actually learn. Within this framework, we show how fundamental properties, like circuit depth and non-Clifford gate count, directly determine whether a model's output leads to efficient classical simulation or surrogation. We argue that this analysis uncovers common pathways to dequantization that underlie many existing simulation methods. More importantly, it reveals critical distinctions between models that are fully simulatable, those whose function space is classically tractable, and those that remain robustly quantum. This perspective provides a conceptual map of this landscape, clarifying how different models relate to classical simulability and pointing to where opportunities for quantum advantage may lie."}

In this work, we introduce a new class of quantum states, called $A_α$-graph states, which are constructed from either unweighted or weighted graphs by taking the normalised convex combination of the degree matrix $D$ and the adjacency matrix $A_G$ of a graph $G$. The constructed states are different from the standard graph states arising from stabiliser formalism. Our approach is also different from the approach used by Braunstein et al. This class of states depend on a tunable mixing parameter $α\\in (0,1]$. We first establish the conditions under which the associated operator $ρ_α^{A_G}$ is positive semidefinite and hence represents a valid quantum state. We then derive a positive partial transposition (PPT) condition for $A_α$-graph states in terms of graph parameters. This PPT condition involves only the Frobenius norm of the adjacency matrix of the graph, the degrees of the vertices and the total number of vertices. For simple graphs, we obtain the range of the parameter $α$ for which the $A_α$-graph states represent a class of entangled states. We then develop a graph-theoretic formulation of a moments-based entanglement detection criterion, focusing on the recently proposed $p_3$-PPT criterion, which relies on the second and third moments of the partial transposition. Since the estimation of these moments is experimentally accessible via randomised measurements, swap operations, and machine-learning-based protocols, our approach provides a physically relevant framework for detecting entanglement in structured quantum states derived from graphs. This work bridges graph theory and moments-based entanglement detection, offering a new perspective on the role of combinatorial structures in quantum correlations."}

A decoder may provide a decoder confidence score (DCS) to gauge its success. We adopt a swim distance DCS, computed from the shortest path between syndrome clusters. By contracting tensor networks, we compare its performance to the well-known complementary gap and find that both reliably estimate the logical error probability (LEP) in a decoding window. We explore ways to use this to mitigate the LEP in entire circuits. For shallow circuits, we just abort if any decoding window produces an exceptionally low DCS: for a distance-13 surface code, rejecting a mere 0.1% of possible DCS values improves the entire circuit's LEP by more than 5 orders of magnitude. For larger algorithms comprising up to trillions of windows, DCS-based rejection remains effective for enhancing observable estimation. Moreover, one can use DCS to assign each circuit's output a unique LEP, and use it as a basis for maximum likelihood inference. This can reduce the effects of noise by an order of magnitude at no quantum cost; methods can be combined for further improvements."}

In addition to giving a surprisingly concise proof of the original random purification theorem, our result implies the existence of fermionic and bosonic Gaussian purification channels. As applications, we obtain the first tomography protocol for fermionic Gaussian states that scales optimally with the number of modes and the error, as well as an improved property test for this class of states."}

We map how interaction strength, lattice depth, lattice wavenumber, and pulse duration reshape the diffraction pattern, leading to an interaction-dependent population redistribution in real and momentum-space. By comparing the exact dynamics to an impulsive sudden-approximation description, we delineate the parameter regimes where it remains accurate and those, notably at strong attraction and small lattice wavenumber, where it fails. Our results provide a controlled few-body benchmark for interacting Kapitza-Dirac scattering and quantitative guidance for Kapitza-Dirac-based probes of ultracold atomic systems."}

The emitters exhibit bright, highly polarized emission that couples efficiently into WS$_2$ waveguides. Under resonant p-shell excitation, we observe high-purity, waveguide-coupled single-photon emission, measured using both an off-chip Hanbury Brown-Twiss configuration ($g^{(2)}(0) = 0.003^{+0.030}_{-0.003}$) and an on-chip configuration ($g^{(2)}(0) = 0.076\\pm0.023$). For a single output, the out-coupled single-photon count rate at the first lens reaches approximately 320 kHz under continuous-wave p-shell excitation, corresponding to an estimated waveguide-coupled rate of 1.7 MHz.

We introduce a photonics-based method that augments graph convolutional networks (GCNs) with PEs derived from light propagation on synthetic frequency lattices whose couplings match the input graph. We simulate propagation and readout to obtain internode intensity correlation matrices, which are used as PEs in GCNs to provide global structural information. Evaluated on Long Range Graph Benchmark molecular datasets, the method outperforms baseline GCNs with Laplacian based PEs, achieving $6.3\\%$ lower mean absolute error for regression and $2.3\\%$ higher average precision for classification tasks using a two-layer GCN as a baseline. When implemented in high repetition rate photonic hardware, correlation measurements can enable fast feature generation by bypassing digital simulation of PEs. Our results show that photonic PEs improve GCN performance and support optical acceleration of graph ML."}
