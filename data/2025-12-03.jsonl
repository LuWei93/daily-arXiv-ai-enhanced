Here we report a monolithic, inverse-designed potassium bromide (KBr) lens that achieves broadband, near-achromatic focusing from 0.45 to 14 $μ$m, a continuous spectral span covering the visible, near-, mid-, and long-wave infrared. This corresponds to a fractional bandwidth of 1.9, approaching the theoretical limit of 2, while maintaining a nearly constant focal length across the entire range. The 19-mm-diameter, 22.5-mm-focal-length optic enables a single compact platform for hyperspectral imaging, mid-IR microscopy, super-resolution, imaging through scattering media, and simultaneous multi-band and long-range imaging. Coupling the KBr lens with a conventional refractive element further yields a hybrid telescope that extends these capabilities. By uniting inverse design with scalable manufacturing, this approach provides a route toward broadly deployable ultra-broadband imagers for biomedicine, climate and environmental monitoring, and space-based sensing."}

The 6x6 electromagnetic polarization matrix introduced here generalizes the conventional electric 3x3 matrix by incorporating both electric and magnetic contributions together with their mutual correlations. It consists of diagonal 3x3 blocks, representing the electric and magnetic polarization matrices, and off-diagonal 3x3 blocks that encode the full structure of electric-magnetic cross-correlations. The information contained in this matrix can be interpreted through physically meaningful quantities such as active and reactive energy fluxes, in-phase and quadrature alignment matrices, and global indices describing electric-magnetic coupling. The formalism is applied to a field composed of two orthogonally propagating plane waves sharing a common linear electric polarization (a simple yet physically realizable configuration) that demonstrates the need for a general combined electric-magnetic representation even in free space. This approach provides a comprehensive and unified framework for characterizing electromagnetic polarization beyond the electric-field description alone, bridging classical statistical optics with quantum-like density-matrix interpretations."}

For the specific case of the Bose-Hubbard model, we explicitly verify that the driven system indeed reproduces SYK physics by direct comparison of the spectral form factor and out-of-time ordered correlation functions (OTOCs).

When both conditions are satisfied, the resulting region is classified as a low-loss ENZ medium combining strong light confinement with reduced optical losses. To achieve this behavior in the mid-IR, heavily doped semiconductors are required, and those compatible with current technologies are most desirable. This work provides the first in-depth study, supported by experimental demonstrations, of the plasmonic properties of highly doped GaN thin films on Si, exhibiting low optical losses and low-loss ENZ characteristics up to $3μm$. From the extracted optical parameters, the ENZ and NZI regions are determined and compared with the existing literature. As a result of the large polar character of nitrides, a hybridization of the surface plasmon and phonon polaritons is observed, accompanied by a flat-dispersion of the high-energy mode (pinned near the plasma frequency) indicative of its ENZ character.

In this work, we present a hybrid Quantum-Classical Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) architecture designed for the binary classification of the BreastMNIST dataset, a standardized benchmark for distinguishing between benign and malignant breast tumors. Our architecture integrates classical convolutional feature extraction with two distinct quantum circuits: an amplitude-encoding variational quantum circuit (VQC) and an angle-encoding VQC circuit with circular entanglement, both implemented on four qubits. These circuits generate quantum feature embeddings that are fused with classical features to form a joint feature space, which is subsequently processed by a fully connected classifier. To ensure fairness, the hybrid QCNN is parameter-matched against a baseline classical CNN, allowing us to isolate the contribution of quantum layers. Both models are trained under identical conditions using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss. Experimental evaluation in five independent runs demonstrates that the hybrid QCNN achieves statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy compared to the classical CNN, as validated by a one-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test (p = 0.03125) and supported by large effect size of Cohen's d = 2.14.

This paper proposes a novel quantum-classical hybrid algorithm that achieves, for the first time, the leap from \"quantum computation of Betti numbers\" to \"quantum acquisition of practical persistence diagrams.\" The algorithm leverages the LGZ quantum algorithm as an efficient feature extractor, mining the harmonic form eigenvectors of the combinatorial Laplacian as well as Betti numbers, constructing specialized topological kernel functions to train a quantum support vector machine (QSVM), and learning the mapping from quantum topological features to persistence diagrams. The core contributions of this algorithm are: (1) elevating quantum topological computation from statistical summaries to pattern recognition, greatly expanding its application value; (2) obtaining more practical topological information in the form of persistence diagrams for real-world applications while maintaining the exponential speedup advantage of quantum computation; (3) proposing a novel hybrid paradigm of \"classical precision guiding quantum efficiency.\" This method provides a feasible pathway for the practical implementation of quantum topological data analysis."}

However, achieving such low-repetition-rate soliton microcombs is nontrivial as long cavities require substantially higher pump power, which induces stronger thermal effects that, in turn, exacerbate thermal instability and complicate access to stable soliton states. The dual-mode pumping scheme, in which a continuous-wave pump couples to both the comb-generating mode and an auxiliary mode, has proven simple and effective for mitigating thermal instability and enabling thermally accessible soliton generation. Yet, in long-cavity devices, the standard bus-to-resonator coupling conditions for these two modes diverge substantially, resulting in insufficient pump coupling to the auxiliary mode, which makes dual-mode pumping particularly challenging for low-repetition-rate microcombs. In this work, we overcome this limitation by coupling the pump to the auxiliary mode via inter-modal coupling, which can be introduced in racetrack microresonators and engineered by tailoring the cavity bend design. We validate this approach in a high-Q (>$10^7$) silicon nitride microresonator and demonstrate thermally accessible, deterministic single-soliton generation at a repetition rate of 33 GHz.

However, its relation to many-body collective properties is poorly understood. Here, we develop a theoretical framework to link quantum phases of matter to their snapshots, based on a combination of data complexity and network theory analyses. The first step in our scheme consists of applying Occam's razor principle to quantum sampling: given snapshots of a wave function, we identify a minimal-complexity measurement basis by analyzing the information compressibility of snapshots over different measurement bases. The second step consists of analyzing arbitrary correlations using network theory, building a wave-function network from the minimal-complexity basis data. This approach allows us to stochastically classify the output of quantum computers and simulations, with no assumptions on the underlying dynamics, and in a fully interpretable manner. We apply this method to quantum states of matter in one-dimensional translational invariant systems, where such classification is exhaustive, and where it reveals an interesting interplay between algorithmic and computational complexity for many-body states. Our framework is of immediate experimental relevance, and can be further extended both in terms of more advanced network mathematics, including discrete homology, as well as in terms of applications to physical phenomena, such as time-dependent dynamics and gauge theories."}

However,the flying focus generated with conventional approaches suffers from a low maximum intensity, as the energy is spread over a long distance, and the size of the focusing optics is also limited. Here, we propose a zone-plate-based flying focus scheme in which the zone widths are modulated by a sinusoidal random distribution. Numerical simulations show that the high-order foci produced by the modulated zone plate can be suppressed by more than two orders of magnitude. Meanwhile, the scheme sustains a high-intensity focal region extending over more than 100 Rayleigh lengths. Furthermore, the focal speed can be tuned over a wide range, including values exceeding the speed of light in vacuum. Owing to these advantages, the proposed modulated zone-plate scheme offers new possibilities for high-intensity laser physics and holds promise for applications such as laser wakefield acceleration, photon acceleration, and more."}

Quantum advantage is achieved when a practical problem is solved more efficiently on a quantum computer than on a classical computer. Demonstrating quantum advantage requires a powerful quantum computer with low error rates and an efficient quantum algorithm that has a useful application. Despite rapid progress in hardware development, we still lack useful applications that are feasible for the next generation of quantum computers. Here we argue that an exponential quantum advantage exists in producing numerical resource estimates of larger quantum algorithms by accurately measuring simulation errors. We provide a quantum algorithm for measuring simulation errors of Trotter-based algorithms. Our results indicate that this method will reduce runtimes of quantum algorithms by approximately three orders of magnitude for one-hundred qubit systems. We also predict that these reductions will increase with system size. The methods we propose require relatively few qubits and operations, meaning the next generation of quantum computers could compute simulation errors for classically intractable systems. Since the underlying computations that lead to reduced resource estimates are infeasible for classical computers, this task is a candidate for demonstrating practical quantum advantage."}

Here, we present a demonstration of a drop-casting based approach to introduce ultrafast plasmonic-mediated coupling: a sparse-layer of silica-gold core-shell nanoparticles is deposited directly onto a W/Fe/Pt spintronic trilayer. This sparse (six percent) decoration increases the wafer-averaged THz pulse energy, pointing to a very high local conversion enhancement for this low-coverage spintronic emitter compared with the bare stack.

On the second, a complete physical theory is one that provides all of the conceptual resources one needs to describe any (in general probabilistic) physical phenomenon to any level of detail one likes, in principle. I argue that while the (neo-)Everettian approach to interpreting quantum mechanics aims to show that it is complete in the first sense, the (neo-)Bohrian approach begins from an understanding of quantum mechanics as being complete in the second sense. I then discuss some of the essential differences between how classical and quantum theory describe phenomena, and the way in which the quantum description can be thought of as a ``natural generalisation'' (to use Bohr's phrase) of the classical description. Finally, I elaborate upon the two visions of physics from which one can motivate the first and the second sense of completeness, respectively: \\emph{metaphysical realism}, on the one hand, and what I will call \\emph{methodological realism}, on the other -- and discuss what one can say about the significance of the differences between quantum and classical description from each of these points of view.

A multi-wavelength beam approach is implemented to enhance the performance by leveraging the distinct propagation characteristics of different wavelengths. Performance is established in terms of the probability of fade, number of fade per second, mean fade duration, and mean time between fades.

Because a single boundary probes only one information direction, combining two boundary placements yields a full-rank Fisher matrix and tight joint Cramér--Rao bounds, while retaining a binary, tomography-free measurement. We outline an integrated-photonics implementation in which an on-chip sink realizes the absorber and estimate a substantial reduction in configuration count compared to mode-resolved qubit tomography. These results identify absorption in quantum walks as a simple and scalable primitive for coin-state metrology."}

However, the readout contrast - an important benchmark for quantum sensing - of V2 ensembles for optically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) is relatively low, usually <1$\\%$ at room temperature. To overcome this challenge, we resonantly excite the V2 ensembles at cryogenic temperatures and compare the results with the off-resonant case. We report a maximum ODMR contrast of 50$\\%$ with only 2 $μ$W of resonant laser power, almost 100 times improvement over off-resonant excitation. We attribute this high readout contrast to a subset of V2 centers that have one spin-selective optical transition resonant with the laser. The ODMR contrast decreases with temperature, approaching the non-resonant contrast by 60 K, likely due to broadening of the optical transition linewidths. We achieve a maximum sensitivity of 100 nT/$\\sqrt{Hz}$ with a resonant laser power of 300 $μ$W, while 100 times more non-resonant excitation power is needed to achieve comparable sensitivity."}

In this work, we use numerics to present explicit results for the time-dependence of these eigenvalues and eigenstates for simple scattering experiments in one and two dimensions. This provides a time-resolved picture of the scattering process, showing in detail how an initial state described entirely in terms of continuous parameters evolves into a discrete set of possible outcomes, each with an associated probability and time-evolving wavefunction. We find that for scattering of Gaussian wavepackets in one dimension, the late time spectrum is dominated by two large eigenvalues nearly equal to the transmission and reflection probabilities associated with the central value of momentum. The corresponding eigenstates appear as single-peaked reflected or transmitted wavepackets. The remaining smaller eigenvalues, which increase to a maximum during scattering and then decrease to small values, correspond to reflected or transmitted wavepackets with multiple spatially separated parts. In this case and also for two-dimensional scattering, we find that successively smaller eigenvalues correspond to probability distributions with successively more peaks. These multi-peaked states correspond to outcomes of the scattering experiment where a particle initially in a single wavepacket ends up in a superposition of separated wavepackets after scattering."}

It has been investigated in many different kinds of targets, including molecular gases, liquids and solids. Recently, high-harmonic generation was studied in organic molecular crystals by Wiechmann et al. [Nat. Commun. 16, 9890 (2025)]. It was found that the laser-polarization-dependent harmonic yield is sensitive to the weak couplings between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor molecules. In this paper, the impact of the laser polarization angle and the intermolecular interaction on the harmonic yield is examined in detail using a simple but insightful two-dimensional tight-binding system that models a molecular dimer, i.e. two weakly coupled molecules. We find that the intensities of lower harmonic orders tend to maximize for a laser polarization direction aligning with the molecular axes, whereas higher harmonic orders rather show the strongest yield for a polarization direction along the intermolecular axis. We further demonstrate that the harmonic order at which the maximum flips from the molecular to the intermolecular direction strongly depends on the intermolecular coupling strength. To gain a deeper insight into the origins of the findings, we include a detailed adiabatic analysis, showing that the flipping of the maximum yield towards the intermolecular direction is already contained qualitatively in the adiabatically following states."}

We establish that the dynamic quantum Fisher information for a thermal probe state is upper bounded by the degree of non-commutation between the transformed local generator and the Hamiltonian for the thermal state. Furthermore, we show that this upper bound scales as the square of the product of the inverse temperature and the evolution time. In the low-temperature limit, we establish an additional upper bound expressed as the seminorm of the commutator divided by the energy gap. We apply this thermal dynamic sensing scheme to various models, demonstrating that the dynamic quantum Fisher information satisfies the established upper bounds."}

A key challenge in this domain is the encoding of input data, which plays a pivotal role in determining the performance of QML models. In this work, we tackle a largely unaddressed aspect of encoding that is unique to QML modeling -- rather than adjusting the ansatz used for encoding, we consider adjusting how data is conveyed to the ansatz. We specifically implement QML pipelines that leverage classical data manipulation (i.e., ordering, selecting, and weighting features) as a preprocessing step, and evaluate if these aspects of encoding can have a significant impact on QML model performance, and if they can be effectively optimized to improve performance. Our experimental results, applied across a wide variety of data sets, ansatz, and circuit sizes, with a representative QML approach, demonstrate that by optimizing how features are encoded in an ansatz we can substantially and consistently improve the performance of QML models, making a compelling case for integrating these techniques in future QML applications. Finally we demonstrate the practical feasibility of this approach by running it using real quantum hardware with 100 qubit circuits and successfully achieving improved QML modeling performance in this case as well."}

We introduce the Quantum-Based Self-Attention for Differentiable Quantum Architecture Search (QBSA-DQAS), a meta-learning framework featuring quantum-based self-attention and hardware-aware multi-objective search. The framework employs a two-stage quantum self-attention module that computes contextual dependencies by mapping architectural parameters through parameterized quantum circuits, replacing classical similarity metrics with quantum-derived attention scores, then applies position-wise quantum transformations for feature enrichment. Architecture search is guided by a task-agnostic multi-objective function jointly optimizing noisy expressibility and Probability of Successful Trials (PST). A post-search optimization stage applies gate commutation, fusion, and elimination to reduce circuit complexity. Experimental validation demonstrates superior performance on VQE tasks and large-scale Wireless Sensor Networks. For VQE on H$_2$, QBSA-DQAS achieves 0.9 accuracy compared to 0.89 for standard DQAS. Post-search optimization reduces discovered circuit complexity by up to 44% in gate count and 47% in depth without accuracy degradation. The framework maintains robust performance across three molecules and five IBM quantum hardware noise models.

However, in large-scale systems, the number of available decoders is much smaller than the number of logical qubits, leading to a fundamental resource shortage. To address this limitation, Virtualized Quantum Decoder (VQD) architectures have been proposed to share a limited pool of decoders across multiple qubits. While the Minimize Longest Undecoded Sequence (MLS) heuristic has been introduced as an effective scheduling policy within the VQD framework, its locally greedy decision-making structure limits its ability to consider global circuit structure, causing inefficiencies in resource balancing and limited scalability. In this work, we propose Constraint-Optimal Driven Allocation (CODA), an optimization-based scheduling algorithm that leverages global circuit structure to minimize the longest undecoded sequence length. Across 19 benchmark circuits, CODA achieves an average 74\\% reduction in the longest undecoded sequence length. Crucially, while the theoretical search space scales exponentially with circuit size, CODA effectively bypasses this combinatorial explosion. Our evaluation confirms that the scheduling time scales linearly with the number of qubits, determined by physical resource constraints rather than the combinatorial search space, ensuring robust scalability for large-scale FTQC systems. These results demonstrate that CODA provides a global optimization-based, scalable scheduling solution that enables efficient decoder virtualization in large-scale FTQC systems."}

Recently, high-harmonic generation was studied in organic molecular crystals by Wiechmann et al. [Nat. Commun. 16, 9890 (2025)]. It was found that the laser-polarization-dependent harmonic yield is sensitive to the weak couplings between nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor molecules. In this paper, the impact of the laser polarization angle and the intermolecular interaction on the harmonic yield is examined in detail using a simple but insightful two-dimensional tight-binding system that models a molecular dimer, i.e. two weakly coupled molecules. We find that the intensities of lower harmonic orders tend to maximize for a laser polarization direction aligning with the molecular axes, whereas higher harmonic orders rather show the strongest yield for a polarization direction along the intermolecular axis. We further demonstrate that the harmonic order at which the maximum flips from the molecular to the intermolecular direction strongly depends on the intermolecular coupling strength. To gain a deeper insight into the origins of the findings, we include a detailed adiabatic analysis, showing that the flipping of the maximum yield towards the intermolecular direction is already contained qualitatively in the adiabatically following states."}

Current progress focuses on integrating optical and electronic components into microfabricated ion traps to allow scaling to large numbers of ion qubits. Most available fabrication strategies for such integrated processors employ monolithic integration of all processor components and rely heavily on CMOS-compatible semiconductor fabrication technologies that are not optimized for the requirements of a trapped-ion quantum processor. In this work, we present a modular approach in which the processor modules, called chiplets, have specific functions and are fabricated separately. The individual chiplets are then combined using heterogeneous integration techniques. This strategy opens up the possibility of choosing the optimal materials and fabrication technology for each of the chiplets, with a minimum amount of fabrication limitations compared to the monolithic approach. Chiplet technology furthermore enables novel processor functionalities to be added in a cost-effective, modular fashion by adding or modifying only a subset of the chiplets. We describe the design concept of a chiplet-based trapped-ion quantum processor and demonstrate the technology with an example of an integrated individual-ion addressing system for a ten-ion crystal. The addressing system emphasizes the modularity of the chiplet approach, combining a surface ion trap manufactured on a glass substrate with a silicon substrate carrying integrated waveguides and a stack of 3D-printed micro-optics, achieving diffraction-limited focal spots at the ion positions."}

We focus on slowly decaying two-body interactions that scale like a power-law $1/r^α$ where $α$ is smaller than the spatial dimension; such interactions are beyond the reach of known stability theorems which only apply to short-range or rapidly decaying long-range perturbations. Our main result is a computation of the ground state splitting of several toy models, which are variants of the 1D Ising model $H = -\\sum_i σ^z_i σ^z_{i+1} + λ\\sum_{ij} |i-j|^{-α} σ^x_i σ^x_j$ with $λ> 0$ and $α< 1$. These models are also closely connected to the Kitaev p-wave wire model with power-law density-density interactions. In these examples, we find that the splitting $δ$ scales like a stretched exponential $δ\\sim \\exp(-C L^{\\frac{1+α}{2}})$ where $L$ is the system size. Our computations are based on path integral techniques similar to the instanton method introduced by Coleman. We also study another toy model with long-range interactions that can be analyzed without path integral techniques and that shows similar behavior."}

Rev. A 95, 062306 (2017)] violates the quantum analogue of Arrow's impossibility theorem. We evaluate this QMR constitution analytically on classical profile data and implement its final measurement stage as a quantum circuit, running on both noiseless simulators and noisy IBM quantum hardware to map how realistic noise deforms the resulting societal ranking distribution. Moderate-high single-qubit noise does not change the qualitative behavior of QMR, whereas strong noise shifts the distribution toward other dominant winners than the classical one. We quantify this behavior using winner-agreement rates, Condorcet-winner flip rates, and Jensen-Shannon divergence between societal ranking distributions. In a second, exploratory component, we demonstrate an explicitly entanglement-based variant of the QMR constitution that serves as a testbed for multi-voter quantum correlations under noise, which we refer to as the QMR2-inspired variant. There, GHZ-type and separable superpositions over opposite rankings have the same expectation values but respond very differently to noise. Taken together, these two components connect the abstract QMR constitution to concrete implementations on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices and highlight design considerations for future quantum voting protocols."}

While quantum theory predicts the existence of macroscopic superpositions, their apparent absence in the everyday world is attributed either to environmental decoherence or to an intrinsic mechanism for wave-function collapse. This work presents a quantitative and experimentally grounded framework for distinguishing these possibilities. We propose a levitated optomechanical platform capable of generating controllable Schrodinger-cat states in the center of mass motion of a dielectric nanosphere. A comprehensive master equation incorporates gas collisions, black-body radiation, and photon-recoil noise, establishing a calibrated environmental baseline. The Continuous Spontaneous Localization (CSL) model is embedded within the same framework, predicting a characteristic saturation of the decoherence rate with superposition size and a quadratic scaling with mass. A Bayesian inference protocol is outlined to discriminate collapse induced excess decoherence from environmental noise. Together these elements provide a concrete experimental blueprint for a decisive test of quantum linearity, either revealing new physics beyond standard quantum mechanics or setting the most stringent bounds to date on objective-collapse parameters."}

Recent work has shown that deciding if a given AVC is symmetrizable or not is a non-Turing computable problem. By relaxing the formulation of symmetrizability, we show the existence of a polynomial-time algorithm that determines whether a given AVC is non-symmetrizable, but displays a critical dependence on the number of jammer input states. We then show how imposing an energy constraint on the jammer allows the same algorithm to efficiently identify large classes of AVCs which are non-symmetrizable."}

In particular, reconfigurable integrated photonic circuits offer a promising route, thanks to the possibility of implementing adaptive feedback loops, which is an essential ingredient for achieving the necessary nonlinear behavior characteristic of neural networks. Here, we implement a quantum reservoir computing protocol in which information is processed through a reconfigurable linear optical integrated photonic circuit and measured using single-photon detectors. We exploit a multiphoton-based setup for time-series forecasting tasks in a variety of scenarios, where the input signal is encoded in one of the circuit's optical phases, thus modulating the quantum reservoir state. The resulting output probabilities are used to set the feedback phases and, at the end of the computation, are fed to a classical digital layer trained via linear regression to perform predictions. We then focus on the investigation of the role of input photon indistinguishability in the reservoir's capabilities of predicting time-series. We experimentally demonstrate that two-photon indistinguishable input states lead to significantly better performance compared to distinguishable ones. This enhancement arises from the quantum correlations present in indistinguishable states, which enable the system to approximate higher-order nonlinear functions when using comparable physical resources, highlighting the importance of quantum interference and indistinguishability as a resource in photonic quantum reservoir computing."}

Breaking unitarity can lead to the purification of mixed initial states, which corresponds to the loss of sensitivity to initial conditions, and hence the absence of a key signature of dynamical chaos. However, the scrambling of quantum information can delay purification to times that are exponential in system size. Here we study purification in systems whose evolution operators are fixed in time, where all aspects of the dynamics are in principle encoded in spectral properties of the evolution operator for a single time step. The operators that we study consist of global Haar random unitary operators and non-unitary single-qubit operations. We show that exponentially slow purification arises from a distribution of eigenvalues in the complex plane that forms a ring with sharp edges at large radii, with the eigenvalue density exponentially large near these edges. We argue that the sharp edges of the eigenvalue distribution arise from level attraction along the radial direction in the complex plane. By calculating the spectral form factor we also show that there is level repulsion around the azimuthal direction, even close to the outer edge of the ring of eigenvalues. Our results connect this spectral signature of quantum chaos to the sensitivity of the system to its initial conditions."}

In this framework, the coherent propagation of a quantum walker over a graph encodes its structural properties into state amplitudes, enabling the identification of highly influential vertices through their transition probabilities. To enhance stability and solution quality, we introduce a dynamic decoupling (``freezing'') mechanism that isolates vertices already selected for the cover, preventing their interference in subsequent iterations of the algorithm. The method employs a compact binary encoding, requiring only $\\lceil \\log_2 (V)\\rceil$ qubits to represent a graph with $V$ vertices, resulting in an exponential reduction of quantum resources compared to conventional vertex-based encodings. We benchmark the proposed heuristic against exact solutions obtained via Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) and against established classical heuristics, including Simulated Annealing, FastVC, and the 2-Approximation algorithm, across Erdős--Rényi, Barabási--Albert and regular random graph ensembles. Our results demonstrate that the CTQW-based heuristic consistently achieves superior approximation ratios and exhibits remarkable robustness with respect to network topology, outperforming classical approaches in both heterogeneous and homogeneous structures. These findings indicate that continuous-time quantum walks, when combined with topology-independent decoupling strategies, provide a powerful paradigm for large-scale combinatorial optimization and complex network control, with potential applications spanning infrastructure resilience, epidemic containment, sensor network optimization, and biological systems analysis."}
