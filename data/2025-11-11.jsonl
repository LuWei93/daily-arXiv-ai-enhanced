However, most of the research led on this platform has primarily focused on applications, rather than material optimization, although the latter is equally important to ensure its technological maturity. In this work, we show that voids, which are commonly found in crystalline AlN-on-sapphire epilayers, have a detrimental role in related photonic structures, as they can lead to propagation losses exceeding 30 dB cm$^{-1}$ at 1550 nm. Their impact on light propagation is further quantified through finite-difference time-domain simulations that reveal that void-related scattering losses are strongly dependent on their size and density in the layer. As a possible solution, we demonstrate that when introducing a thin sputtered AlN buffer layer prior to initiating AlN epitaxial growth, void-free layers are obtained. They exhibit intrinsic quality factors in microring resonators as high as $2.0\\times 10^6$, corresponding to propagation losses lower than 0.2 dB cm$^{-1}$ at 1550 nm. These void-free layers are further benchmarked for high-power applications through second-harmonic and supercontinuum generation in dispersion-engineered waveguides. Such layers are highly promising candidates for short-wavelength photonic integrated circuit applications, particularly given the strong potential of AlN for visible photonics. Given that volumetric scattering losses scale as $λ^{-4}$, the platform quality becomes increasingly critical in the visible and ultraviolet range, where our improved layers are expected to deliver enhanced performance."}

The generation and manipulation of biphoton entanglement in topologically distinct modes paves the way in this direction.

Our method enables the generation of topological biphoton states with injected pump activation on the topologically trivial modes. This is realized through self-induced manipulation on pump-dependent nonlinear couplings on the defects, which is unable to be realized while there are no such nonlinear couplings. Specifically, by including the nonlinear gain/loss mechanism in the coupling between the nearest-neighbor waveguides and the third-order Kerr nonlinearity effect along the waveguides, the injected pump power will be the controllable parameter for the manipulation of the topology in the defect states and the generation of biphoton entanglement states. We also present an experimental proposal to realize our scheme and its generalization in the contemporaneous \"active\" topological photonics time-bin platforms. Our method can be used in other Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models with various defect configurations.

This tutorial and survey reviews recent advances in HAPS optical communication and integration with atmospheric remote sensing via shared optical links. Among several sensing techniques, Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) is identified as most promising due to its range-resolved sensitivity, spectral selectivity, and compatibility with HAPS constraints. A roadmap is outlined for implementing telecom-band DIAL on HAPS alongside high-throughput FSO systems. The paper analyzes architectural and atmospheric advantages of HAPS over terrestrial and satellite nodes, emphasizing spatial-temporal coverage, station-keeping ability, and support for compact laser payloads such as DIAL, in-situ sensors, and multispectral imagers. It highlights the feasibility of co-locating sensing and communication within a shared optical and power envelope, especially in the telecom C-band (1.53-1.57 um), enabling trace-gas retrieval (CO2, CH4, N2O, H2S, O3) while maintaining multi-Gbps downlinks. Suitable HAPS architectures (balloons, UAVs, airships) and use cases are identified where integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-enabled HAPS outperform satellites and UAVs, including greenhouse gas monitoring, disaster response, air-quality mapping, and 6G NTN extensions. A literature survey for 2005-2025 shows HAPS publications have tripled since 2014, indicating rapid growth.

For a special class of defects, namely conformal defects, we present analytical and numerical results for the temporal growth of number entropy, the time evolution of the number distribution, and the eigenvalue profile of the associated correlation matrix within a subsystem. We show that the number entropy exhibits logarithmic growth in time, originating from the Gaussian structure of the number distribution. We find that the eigenvalue dynamics reveal a profound connection to the reflection and transmission coefficients of the associated scattering problem for a broad range of defects. When stochastic processes are introduced, specifically Stochastic Unitary Processes (SUP) and Quantum State Diffusion (QSD), the number entropy scales as $\\ln(t)$ in the SUP case and shows strong hints of $\\ln [\\ln(t)]$ scaling in the QSD case.

However, current protocols for optical topology realization rely on paraxial propagation of spatial modes, which inherently limits their three-dimensional topological structures to longitudinal space-filling. In this work we propose and experimentally demonstrate a scheme for creating optical knots and links that are localized in space within a transverse plane of a paraxial field, as well as in time. These spatiotemporal topological structures arise from polychromatic wave fields with tightly coupled spatial and temporal degrees of freedom that can be realized in the form of superpositions of toroidal light vortices of opposite topological charges. The (2+1)-dimensional nature of a toroidal light vortex imparts spatiotemporally localized wave fields with nontrivial topological textures, encompassing both individual and nested links or knots configurations. Moreover, the resulting topological textures are localized on an ultrashort timescale propagate at the group velocity of the wave packets and exhibit remarkable topological robustness during propagation as optical carriers. The nascent connection between spatiotemporally localized fields and topology offers exciting prospects for advancing space-time photonic topologies and exploring their potential applications in high-capacity informatics and communications."}

Despite its significance, optical devices operating in this band still face two major challenges: chromatic aberration across the wide spectral range and the difficulty of integration due to bulky optical elements. Metalenses are composed of subwavelength nanostructures that locally control the phase and group delay of light, enabling precise wavefront shaping and broadband dispersion compensation. These capabilities make them highly promising for use in infrared optical systems, particularly in applications such as focusing and imaging for compact integrated devices. In this study, we propose a metalens design based on a CaF2 substrate, where each nanocell consists of a single-bar silicon structure. These nanocells are periodically arranged with a 900 nm period, enabling precise control of dispersion and phase. By systematically finetuning the bar length and width, the design enables simultaneous dispersion compensation and phase modulation, achieving stable focusing performance over a broad spectral range. Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations demonstrate that the metalens design achieves effective suppression of chromatic aberration in the 1800-2300 nm range, maintaining a stable focal position throughout the bandwidth with variation within 6% of the focal length. This design offers a compact, broadband, and high-performance approach for beam collimation and wavefront shaping in the SWIR band, with promising potential for applications in quantum communication and sensing systems."}

It combines the propagated wavefields from individual sensors through a computational phase synchronization scheme, eliminating the need for overlapping measurement regions to establish phase coherence. Light diffraction in MASI naturally expands the imaging field, generating phase-contrast visualizations that are substantially larger than sensor dimensions.

Perfect correction of these Gaussian lossy channels with Gaussian operations alone is known to be impossible. In this work, we investigate the Petz recovery map as an approximate recovery. We construct the Petz recovery of single mode losses and its implementations. In particular, we show that the recovery performance of Petz recovery map is better than the recovery protocol that replaces the noisy state with the belief state. Also, when the reference state is far from the true state, it is better not to use the Petz recovery map but to leave the noisy state instead. We discuss the physical intuition of Petz recovery map and finally shows that it is near-optimal among the considered recovery protocols."}

Current image-based methods of super-resolution require phase information (either of the source points or an added filter) and perfect alignment with the centroid of the object. Both inhibit the practical application of these methods, as uniform motion and/or relative jitter destroy their assumptions. Here, we show that measuring intensity in the Fourier plane enables super-resolution without any of the issues of image-based methods. We start with the shift-invariance of the Fourier transform and the observation that the two-point position problem ${x_1,x_2}$ in the near field corresponds to the single-point wavenumber problem $k\\ =2π/(x_2-x_1)$ in the far field. We consider the full range of mutual coherence and show that for fully coherent sources, the Fourier method saturates the quantum limit, i.e. it gives the best possible measurement. Similar results hold for sub-Rayleigh constellations of N sources, which can act collectively as a spatially averaged metasurface and/or individually as elements of a phased-array antenna. The theory paves the way to merge Fourier optics with super-resolution techniques, enabling experimental devices that are both simpler and more robust than previous designs."}

The combination of high-resolution molecular mapping and broad mesoscale imaging in a portable platform opens new possibilities from rapid clinical diagnostics, tissue analysis, to biological characterization in space exploration."}

Considering a tagged vector space where the index space is a function space, representing the additional degrees of freedom, we obtained axioms for the tags that include a completeness condition expressed in terms of a functional integral with an abstract functional integration measure. Using these axioms, we derive a generating functional for the moments of this functional integration measure. These moments are then used to evaluate the functional integrals of Gaussian functionals, leading to expressions in accordance with those obtained as generalizations of equivalent integrals over a finite number of integration variables. For a Gaussian functional used as a probability distributions, we show that its moments, obtained with this functional integration measure, satisfy Carleman's condition, indicating that the measure is unique."}

The architecture employs dual networks for decoding real and imaginary field components, avoiding phase-wrapping discontinuities plagued in amplitude-phase representations. A gradient-domain loss on spatial derivatives ensures robust convergence. We demonstrate video-rate gigapixel imaging with centimeter-scale coverage while resolving 308-nm linewidths. Validations span from monitoring sample dynamics of crystals, bacteria, stem cells, microneedle to characterizing time-varying probes in extreme ultraviolet experiments, demonstrating versatility across wavelengths. By transforming temporal variations from a constraint into exploitable correlations, we establish that gigapixel video is tractable with single-sensor measurements, making ptychography a high-throughput sensing tool for monitoring mesoscale dynamics without lenses."}

Respectively, we analyse permutational computing transition amplitudes, evaluate barren plateaus for SU(2) symmetric ansätze, study properties of AKLT states, and derive the minimum quantised volume in loop quantum gravity.\n  Our starting point is the mixed-dimensional ZX calculus, a purely diagrammatic language that has been proven to be complete for finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.

We embed the Spin-ZX calculus inside the mixed-dimensional ZX calculus, rendering it a quantum information flavoured diagrammatic language for the quantum theory of angular momentum, i.e. SU(2) representation theory. We diagrammatically derive the fundamental spin coupling objects - such as Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, symmetrising mappings between qubits and spin spaces, and spin Hamiltonians - under this embedding.\n  Our results establish the Spin-ZX calculus as a powerful tool for representing and computing with SU(2) systems graphically, offering new insights into foundational relationships and paving the way for new diagrammatic algorithms for theoretical physics."}

To overcome these limitations, monolithic electronic-photonic integrated circuits (EPICs), enabling miniaturized and synergistic integration of both RF and photonic components, are gaining notable attention. As a groundbreaking advancement, we demonstrate a novel photonic RF receiver that monolithically integrates a bow-tie antenna and a microring modulator on a thin-film lithium niobate platform.

To address this, we developed ET2dNet, a deep learning-based EPI-TIRF cross-modality network that achieves TIRF-comparable background subtraction and axial super-resolution from a single wide-field image without requiring hardware modifications. The model employs a physics-informed hybrid architecture, synergizing supervised learning with registered EPI-TIRF image pairs and self-supervised physical modeling via convolution with the point spread function. This framework ensures exceptional generalization across microscope objectives, enabling few-shot adaptation to new imaging setups. Rigorous validation on cellular and tissue samples confirms ET2dNet's superiority in background suppression and axial resolution enhancement, while maintaining compatibility with deconvolution techniques for lateral resolution improvement. Furthermore, by extending this paradigm through knowledge distillation, we developed ET3dNet, a dedicated three-dimensional reconstruction network that produces artifact-reduced volumetric results. ET3dNet effectively removes out-of-focus background signals even when the input image stack lacks the source of background. This framework makes axial super-resolution imaging more accessible by providing an easy-to-deploy algorithm that avoids additional hardware costs and complexity, showing great potential for live cell studies and clinical histopathology."}

However, it becomes self-limiting in complex optimizations like the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model: long evolution times $T$ needed to traverse crossings force the CD strength to scale as $1/T$, causing it to vanish before convergence and wasting the quantum resources invested in its implementation. We break this trade-off with a Hybrid adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (HAVQDS). HAVQDS combines adaptive real-time evolution for circuit compression with imaginary-time steps that suppress excitations at no extra gate cost. For the SK model (6--14 qubits), HAVQDS achieves higher approximation ratios than adiabatic or CD approaches, while reducing CNOT counts by 1--2 orders of magnitude, enabling high-fidelity quantum optimization."}

This theoretical framework integrates the geometric formalism of transformation optics with the thermodynamic principles found in quantum dissipative systems. This concept goes beyond traditional coordinate transformations by affecting the distribution of quantum energy and entropy in a coherent thermodynamic manner as well as reshaping electromagnetic fields. By employing the thermofield dynamics approach, we establish new rules that show how local energy and entropy densities are influenced by the Jacobian determinant of the mapping. This indicates that when the geometry is compressed, it increases the generation of quantum energy and entropy density, while expansion has the opposite effect, all while adhering to the laws of conservation and the second law of thermodynamics.\n  As a practical test, we reformulate the Casimir effect within this framework, yielding a continuous pressure law that connects the quantum and classical realms via a thermal weighting function. This relationship illustrates how both geometry and temperature jointly determine quantum pressure. Additionally, our numerical results for Drude-Lorentz metamaterials support our analytical predictions and align closely with the comprehensive Lifshitz-Matsubara formulation. In fact, QTTO offers a powerful and coherent platform for exploring energy, entropy, and quantum pressure in real-world dissipative media. Beyond our immediate findings, it opens up a systematic pathway for managing quantum thermal processes and controlling field fluctuations in metamaterials and curved optical environments."}

In this work, we overcome this limitation by harnessing exceptional points of non-Hermitian physics. We introduce and experimentally realize quasi-exceptional-point metasurfaces that exploit engineered singularities to directly impart a geometric phase onto linearly polarized light. Proof-of-principle demonstrations with gratings and holograms confirm broadband and high-fidelity wavefront shaping across arbitrary linear polarizations, which has not been achieved with previous phase modulation approaches.

By adjusting pump energy, we induce a transition from uniform angular photoluminescence to a strongly directional emission peak at large angles in the amplified spontaneous emission and RL regimes. This directionality arises from enhanced spatial coherence in the strong scattering regime, enabling coupling of guided random-laser modes to high-angle diffraction through the metasurface grating.

This formulation compresses the design space by more than an order of magnitude, enabling efficient optimization of complex, broadband, and aperiodic geometries. GiBS integrates this low-dimensional representation with an autoencoder-based manifold-learning workflow to map the relationship between geometry and optical response, facilitating rapid exploration, discovery of high-performance designs, and systematic analysis of fabrication sensitivity.

This allows for continuous control over the trade-off among correct, incorrect, and inconclusive outcomes. While the asymptotic key rate improvement over B92 is modest, phiQKD offers a practical advantage by enabling adaptability to noise and channel imperfections via measurement tunability. By evaluating the protocol under asymptotic, finite-key, and composable security models, we show that, treating quantum measurement as a tunable design parameter, rather than a fixed operation, enables flexible protocol optimization and improved performance under realistic constraints."}

Such controllability is highly desirable both for digital quantum information processing and for analog quantum simulations of various physical phenomena, such as arbitrary spin-spin interactions.

This unitary is then post-processed using the projective cluster-additive transformation (PCAT) to ensure cluster additivity, a key requirement for NLCE convergence. We benchmark our method on the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) in one and two dimensions, and with longitudinal field, computing one quasi-particle dispersions in the high-field polarized phase. We compare two cost function classes, trace minimization and variance-based, demonstrating their effectiveness with the Hamiltonian variational ansatz (HVA). For pure TFIM, $\\lceil N/2 \\rceil$ layers suffice: NLCE+VQE matches exact diagonalization.

The recently introduced Clifford Augmented Matrix Product State (CAMPS) method offer scalability and efficiency by combining both tensor network and stabilizer simulation techniques and leveraging their complementary advantages. This hybrid simulation method has indeed demonstrated significant improvements in simulation performance for qubit circuits. Our work generalises the CAMPS method to higher quantum degrees of freedom -- qudit simulation, resulting in a generalised CAMPS (GCAMPS). Benchmarking this extended simulator on quantum systems with three degrees of freedom, i.e. qutrits, we show that similar to the case of qubits, qutrit systems also benefit from a comparable speedup using these techniques. Indeed, we see a greater improvement with qutrit simulation compared to qubit simulation on the same $T$-doped random Clifford benchmarking circuit as a result of the increased difficulty of conventional qutrit simulation using tensor networks. This extension allows for the classical simulation of problems that were previously intractable without access to a quantum device and will open new avenues to study complex many-body physics and to develop efficient methods for quantum information processing."}

We show that the number entropy exhibits logarithmic growth in time, originating from the Gaussian structure of the number distribution. We find that the eigenvalue dynamics reveal a profound connection to the reflection and transmission coefficients of the associated scattering problem for a broad range of defects.

While expanding the quantum ISA with high-fidelity, expressive basis gates is a key path forward, it imposes significant gate calibration overhead and complicates compiler optimization. As a result, even though more powerful ISAs have been designed, their use remains largely conceptual rather than practical.\n  To move beyond these hurdles, we introduce the concept of \"reconfigurable quantum instruction set computers\" (ReQISC), which incorporates: (1) a unified microarchitecture capable of directly implementing arbitrary 2Q gates equivalently, i.e., SU(4) modulo 1Q rotations, with theoretically optimal gate durations given any 2Q coupling Hamiltonians; (2) a compilation framework tailored to ReQISC primitives for end-to-end synthesis and optimization, comprising a program-aware pass that refines high-level representations, a program-agnostic pass for aggressive circuit-level optimization, and an SU(4)-aware routing pass that minimizes hardware mapping overhead.\n  We detail the hardware implementation to demonstrate the feasibility, in terms of both pulse control and calibration of this superior gate scheme on realistic hardware. By leveraging the expressivity of SU(4) and the time minimality realized by the underlying microarchitecture, the SU(4)-based ISA achieves remarkable performance, with a 4.97-fold reduction in average pulse duration to implement arbitrary 2Q gates, compared to the usual CNOT/CZ scheme on mainstream flux-tunable transmons. Supported by the end-to-end compiler, ReQISC outperforms the conventional CNOT-ISA, SOTA compiler, and pulse implementation counterparts, in significantly reducing 2Q gate counts, circuit depth, pulse duration, qubit mapping overhead, and program fidelity losses. For the first time, ReQISC makes the theoretical benefits of continuous ISAs practically feasible."}

One major challenge in realizing surface-code-based FTQC is the extremely large number of qubits required. To mitigate this problem, fusing multiple codewords of the surface code into a densely packed configuration has been proposed. It is known that by using dense packing, the number of physical qubits required per logical qubit can be reduced to approximately three-fourths compared to simply placing surface-code patches side by side. Despite its potential, concrete deformation procedures and quantitative error-rate analyses have remained largely unexplored. In this work, we present a detailed code-deformation procedure that transforms multiple standard surface code patches into a densely packed, connected configuration, along with a conceptual microarchitecture to utilize this dense packing. We also propose a CNOT gate-scheduling for stabilizer measurement circuits that suppresses hook errors in the densely packed surface code. We performed circuit-level Monte Carlo noise simulation of densely packed surface codes using this gate scheduling. The numerical results demonstrate that as the code distance of the densely packed surface code increases and the physical error rate decreases, the logical error rate of the densely packed surface code becomes lower than that of the standard surface code. Furthermore, we find that only when employing hook-error-avoiding syndrome extraction can the densely packed surface code achieve a lower logical error rate than the standard surface code, while simultaneously reducing the space overhead."}

Recent theoretical studies have offered much insights into these phenomena through the non-Bloch band theory, though many of the theory's key features are experimentally elusive. For instance, the correspondence between complex momenta and non-Hermitian bands, while central to non-Bloch band theory, has so far defied direct experimental observation. Here we experimentally study the non-Hermitian spectral deformation in complex-momentum space, by implementing a non-Hermitian lattice with long-range couplings in the synthetic orbital-angular-momentum (OAM) dimension of photons inside a degenerate cavity. Encoding the complex momenta in the phase and amplitude modulations of the OAM modes, and devising a complex-momentum-resolved projective detection, we reconstruct the spectral deformation in momentum space, where the eigenspectrum on the complex plane morphs through distinct geometries. This enables us to experimentally extract key information of the system under the non-Bloch band theory, including exceptional points in the complex-momentum space, the open-boundary spectra, and the generalized Brillouin zone. Our work demonstrates a versatile platform for exploring non-Hermitian physics and non-Bloch band theory, and opens the avenue for direct experimental investigation of non-Bloch features in the complex-momentum space."}

A central aspect of our analysis is the choice of basis for $\\hat{A}_1$, which is composed of skew-symmetric combinations of two elements of the Weyl algebra called monomials, namely strings of creation and annihilation operators combined with their hermitian conjugate. Motivated by the quest for analytical solutions in quantum optimal control and dynamics, we aim at answering the following three fundamental questions: (i) What are the finite-dimensional Lie subalgebras in $\\hat{A}_1$ generated by monomials alone?

A collection of RL agents is trained within robust simulation environments, enabling the identification of effective control strategies even under noisy conditions. Selected agents are then validated on higher-fidelity simulations, illustrating how RL-based methods can reduce calibration overhead when compared to quantum optimal control techniques. Furthermore, the RL approach is hardware agnostic with the potential for broad applicability across various quantum computing platforms."}

Quantum error mitigation (QEM) techniques are leading solutions to improve computation fidelity with relatively low qubit-overhead, while full-scale quantum error correction remains a distant goal. However, QEM techniques incur substantial measurement overheads, especially when applied to families of quantum circuits parameterized by classical inputs. Focusing on zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE), a widely adopted QEM technique, here we devise the surrogate-enabled ZNE (S-ZNE), which leverages classical learning surrogates to perform ZNE entirely on the classical side. Unlike conventional ZNE, whose measurement cost scales linearly with the number of circuits, S-ZNE requires only constant measurement overhead for an entire family of quantum circuits, offering superior scalability. Theoretical analysis indicates that S-ZNE achieves accuracy comparable to conventional ZNE in many practical scenarios, and numerical experiments on up to 100-qubit ground-state energy and quantum metrology tasks confirm its effectiveness. Our approach provides a template that can be effectively extended to other quantum error mitigation protocols, opening a promising path toward scalable error mitigation."}

For the translation-invariant BDI and AIII free-fermion classes, it has been shown that the underlying skeleton is dense, giving an analytic approach to MPS approximation of ground states anywhere in the class. In this paper, we partially expose the skeleton in certain interacting spin chains: the $N$-state Onsager-integrable chiral clock families. We construct MPS that form a dense MPS skeleton in the gapped regions surrounding a sequence of fixed-point Hamiltonians (the generators of the Onsager algebra). Outside these gapped regions, these MPS remain eigenstates, but no longer give the many-body ground state. Rather, they are ground states in particular sectors of the spectrum. Our methods also allow us to find further MPS eigenstates; these correspond to low-lying excited states within the aforementioned gapped regions. This set of MPS excited states goes beyond the previous analysis of ground states on the $N=2$ free-fermion MPS skeleton. As an application of our results, we find a closed form for the disorder parameter in a family of interacting models.

We define the difference between the minimum daemonic ergotropy and the maximum ergotropy of the battery as the daemonic gap at the time where the ergotropy of the battery is maximum. Considering a harmonic mode as the battery and a qubit as the auxiliary charger interacting via Jaynes-Cummings interaction, we show that the daemonic gap can be closed for specific initial passive states of the battery, including the ground state, truncated mixtures of low-lying states, and canonical thermal states. We further define the daemonic band as the difference between the maximum and the minimum daemonic ergotropy, and show that starting from the ground state of the single-mode battery, the daemonic band collapses. We also show that achieving a complete charging, along with accessing the full daemonic band, is possible for the single-mode battery using all of the other initial states by repeating the charging cycle and maximizing ergotropy in every round. We extend the battery-charger design to a multi-mode resonator battery and a qudit charger, and demonstrate, for a double-mode battery and a qutrit charger, that repeating the charging cycle is vital for simultaneously charging individual modes of the collective battery."}

Rojas-González"], "title": "Transport regimes of biphoton-state quantum walks in ordered and disordered arrays of nonlinear waveguides", "comment": "12 pages, 11 figures", "summary": "It is well known that a quantum walk in an ordered medium exhibits ballistic propagation. A related process is the driven quantum walk, in which the number of walkers varies over time. In this work, we show that a driven quantum walk in an array of nonlinear waveguides does not propagate ballistically, but instead exhibits two distinct transport regimes: superballistic and superdiffusive. Moreover, we study the effects of off-diagonal and diagonal disorder. In addition to the observation of Anderson localization, both types of disorder lead to the disappearance of the superballistic regime."}

Yet, no efficient protocol exists for certifying states generated in the Magic-State Injection model -- the foundation of several fault-tolerant quantum computing architectures. Here, we introduce an efficient protocol for certifying Clifford-enhanced Product States, a large class of quantum states obtained by applying an arbitrary Clifford circuit to a product of single-qubit, possibly magic, states. Our protocol only requires single-qubit Pauli measurements together with efficient classical post-processing, and has efficient sample complexity in both the independent (i.i.d.) and adversarial (non-i.i.d.) settings. This fills a key gap between Pauli-based certification schemes for stabilizer or (hyper)graph states and general protocols demanding non-Pauli measurements or classically intractable information about the target state. Our work provides the first efficient, Pauli-only certification protocol for the Magic-State Injection model, leading to practical verification of universal quantum computation under minimal experimental assumptions."}

Hence entanglement mediated by gravity remains an unambiguous witness of gravity's quantum features."}

Brody", "Rishindra Melanathuru"], "title": "Decoherence from universal tomographic measurements", "comment": "5 pages, 1 figure", "summary": "The decoherence phenomenon arising from an environmental monitoring of the state of a quantum system, as opposed to monitoring of a preferred observable, is worked out in detail using two equivalent formulations, namely, repeated applications of universal tomographic measurements using positive operator-valued measures, and its continuous time unravelling from the Lindblad equation. The effect of decoherence is analysed by studying the evolution of Stratonovich-Weyl quasiprobability distributions on the state-space of the system. It is shown that decoherence makes an arbitrary-given quasiprobability distribution manifestly positive, thus modelling the emergence of classicality in some sense. The decoherence timescale, the minimum time that quasiprobability distributions of every initial state of the system become nonnegative, is shown to decrease in Hilbert-space dimension, and hence larger quantum systems decohere faster."}

In this work, we extend QAOA-GPT to Higher-Order Unconstrained Binary Optimization (HUBO) problems, focusing on spin-glass Hamiltonians that include cubic interaction terms. Using FEATHER graph embeddings to encode topological information, we train the model on graph-circuit pairs generated via ADAPT-QAOA and evaluate its performance on 8- and 16-qubit instances embedded on heavy-hex lattices. The generative model produces adaptive QAOA-like circuits and corresponding variational parameters in a single forward pass, bypassing the iterative classical optimization loop. The generated circuits achieve average approximation ratios exceeding 0.95, closely matching classically optimized ADAPT-QAOA results, while maintaining consistent parameter distributions across circuit depths. These results demonstrate that QAOA-GPT generalizes effectively to higher-order cost Hamiltonians and complex energy landscapes, establishing generative modeling as a scalable pathway toward autonomous variational circuit design and quantum algorithm discovery in the NISQ era."}

Initial results demonstrated how we can utilize multipartite entanglement distribution to determine error probabilities of single-Pauli channels and depolarizing channels. In this work, we show how the analysis of quantum capacity regions can be used as a powerful new tool in quantum network tomography. As a first application of the proposed method, we demonstrate how we can characterize the loss on quantum channels in the network directly from quantum capacity region diagrams, even in the presence of bit-flip errors. Our results indicate that quantum capacity regions are not only valuable for network design, resource allocation, and protocol benchmarking, but also show promise for applications in quantum network tomography, particularly in loss tomography."}

Depending on the height of the junction barrier, the emitted excitations appear as vortex rings at low velocity or vorticity-free rarefaction pulses near the sound velocity, thus spanning the complete Jones-Roberts family of solitons. The Shapiro-step phenomenon renders the emission deterministic: on the first, second, third Shapiro steps, the junction ejects one, two, and three solitary excitations per drive cycle. This enables controlled generation of single- and multi-excitation configurations, allowing detailed studies of the full crossover between vortex rings and rarefaction pulses and their interaction dynamics. In particular, deterministic multi-ring emission provides insights into leapfrogging dynamics of two and three coaxial rings and their decay via boundary-assisted, sound-mediated processes. This ac-driven protocol establishes a compact and reproducible platform for generating, classifying, and controlling 3D solitonic excitations, paving the way for precision studies of nonlinear vortex dynamics, dissipation, and quantum turbulence in trapped superfluids."}

Wadood", "Shaurya Aarav", "Kevin Liang", "Jason W Fleischer"], "title": "Super-resolution with Fourier measurements", "comment": null, "summary": "Resolving sources beyond the diffraction limit is important in imaging, communications, and metrology. Current image-based methods of super-resolution require phase information (either of the source points or an added filter) and perfect alignment with the centroid of the object. Both inhibit the practical application of these methods, as uniform motion and/or relative jitter destroy their assumptions. Here, we show that measuring intensity in the Fourier plane enables super-resolution without any of the issues of image-based methods. We start with the shift-invariance of the Fourier transform and the observation that the two-point position problem ${x_1,x_2}$ in the near field corresponds to the single-point wavenumber problem $k\\ =2π/(x_2-x_1)$ in the far field. We consider the full range of mutual coherence and show that for fully coherent sources, the Fourier method saturates the quantum limit, i.e. it gives the best possible measurement. Similar results hold for sub-Rayleigh constellations of N sources, which can act collectively as a spatially averaged metasurface and/or individually as elements of a phased-array antenna. The theory paves the way to merge Fourier optics with super-resolution techniques, enabling experimental devices that are both simpler and more robust than previous designs."}

With the aid of density--potential functional theory (DPFT), which can accurately simulate Fermi gases in realistic settings, we propose and characterize a barbell-shaped trapping potential, where a bridge-shaped potential connects two ring-shaped potentials. In the strongly repulsive regime, each of the ring traps eventually stores one of the fermion species. Our simulations are a guide to designing component filters for initially mixed, weakly repulsive spin components. We demonstrate that the functioning of this barbell design is robust against variations in experimental settings, for example, across particle numbers, for small deformations of the trap geometry, or if interatomic interactions differ from the bare contact repulsion. Our investigation marks the first step in establishing DPFT as a comprehensive simulation framework for fermionic atomtronics."}
