Comments welcome!", "summary": "Adiabatic reverse annealing (ARA) has been proposed as an improvement to\nconventional quantum annealing for solving optimization problems, in which one\ntakes advantage of an initial guess at the solution to suppress problematic\nphase transitions. Here we interpret the performance of ARA through its effects\non the free energy landscape, and use the intuition gained to introduce a\nclassical analogue to ARA termed ``simulated reverse annealing'' (SRA). This\nmakes it more difficult to claim that ARA provides a quantum advantage in\nsolving a given problem, as not only must ARA succeed but the corresponding SRA\nmust fail. As a solvable example, we analyze how both protocols behave in the\ninfinite-range (non-disordered) $p$-spin model. Through both the thermodynamic\nphase diagrams and explicit dynamical behavior, we establish that the quantum\nalgorithm has no advantage over its classical counterpart: SRA succeeds not\nonly in every case where ARA does but even in a narrow range of parameters\nwhere ARA fails."}

Recent excitation schemes strategically\ntry to exploit pulses that excite the qubit while avoiding spectral overlap to\nbypass this required filtering. In this work, we compare three such pumping\nschemes to quantify the important SPS figures-of-merit for off-resonant quantum\ndot schemes, using: (i) a symmetrically detuned dichromatic pulse, (ii) a\nnotch-filtered adiabatic rapid passage (NARP) pulse, and (iii) a swing up of\nthe quantum emitter population (SUPER) pulse.

However,\nmachine learning and side-channel attacks increasingly undermine their\nclassical assumptions, calling for new approaches to ensure unforgeability.\nQuantum mechanics naturally supports this goal through intrinsic randomness and\nthe no-cloning theorem, motivating the study of Quantum Physical Unclonable\nFunctions (QPUFs). Yet, existing QPUF models often assume ideal unitary\ndynamics, neglecting non-unitary effects such as decoherence and dissipation\nthat arise in real quantum devices. This work introduces a new class of\nnon-unitary QPUFs that leverage open quantum system dynamics as a foundation\nfor security. Three architectures are proposed: the Dissipative QPUF (D-QPUF),\nwhich uses amplitude damping as an entropy source; the Measurement-Feedback\nQPUF (MF-QPUF), which employs mid-circuit measurements and conditional\nunitaries; and the Lindbladian QPUF (L-QPUF), which models Markovian noise via\nthe Lindblad master equation and Trotter-Suzuki decomposition. Simulation\nresults show that these non-unitary designs achieve strong uniqueness,\nuniformity, and unforgeability, with controllable reliability trade-offs from\nstochastic noise. The L-QPUF, in particular, exhibits exponential modeling\nresistance under limited challenge-response access.
