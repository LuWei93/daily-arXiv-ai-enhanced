TL;DR: 研究发现氮化铝(AIN)光子结构中的空洞会导致高达30 dB cm⁻¹的传播损耗，通过引入溅射AIN缓冲层可获得无空洞层，使微环谐振器本征Q因子达到2.0×10⁶，传播损耗低于0.2 dB cm⁻¹，在可见光和紫外波段具有重要应用前景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然氮化铝(AIN)因其低传播损耗、宽透明窗口和光学非线性特性成为集成光子学的有吸引力材料，但大多数研究关注应用而非材料优化。本研究旨在解决AIN-on-sapphire外延层中常见空洞对光子结构性能的负面影响。

Method: 通过有限差分时域模拟量化空洞对光传播的影响，并引入溅射AIN缓冲层在AIN外延生长前，获得无空洞层。使用微环谐振器测量本征Q因子，并在色散工程波导中进行二次谐波和超连续谱生成测试。

Result: 空洞会导致传播损耗超过30 dB cm⁻¹，而无空洞层在微环谐振器中实现2.0×10⁶的本征Q因子，对应1550 nm波长下传播损耗低于0.2 dB cm⁻¹。无空洞层在二次谐波和超连续谱生成中表现出色。

Conclusion: 无空洞AIN层是短波长光子集成电路应用的高潜力候选材料，特别是在可见光和紫外波段，由于体积散射损耗与λ⁻⁴成正比，改进后的层有望在这些波段提供增强性能。

Abstract: In recent years, aluminum nitride (AlN) has emerged as an attractive material for integrated photonics due to its low propagation losses, wide transparency window, and presence of both second- and third-order optical nonlinearities. However, most of the research led on this platform has primarily focused on applications, rather than material optimization, although the latter is equally important to ensure its technological maturity. In this work, we show that voids, which are commonly found in crystalline AlN-on-sapphire epilayers, have a detrimental role in related photonic structures, as they can lead to propagation losses exceeding 30 dB cm$^{-1}$ at 1550 nm. Their impact on light propagation is further quantified through finite-difference time-domain simulations that reveal that void-related scattering losses are strongly dependent on their size and density in the layer. As a possible solution, we demonstrate that when introducing a thin sputtered AlN buffer layer prior to initiating AlN epitaxial growth, void-free layers are obtained. They exhibit intrinsic quality factors in microring resonators as high as $2.0\times 10^6$, corresponding to propagation losses lower than 0.2 dB cm$^{-1}$ at 1550 nm. These void-free layers are further benchmarked for high-power applications through second-harmonic and supercontinuum generation in dispersion-engineered waveguides. Such layers are highly promising candidates for short-wavelength photonic integrated circuit applications, particularly given the strong potential of AlN for visible photonics. Given that volumetric scattering losses scale as $λ^{-4}$, the platform quality becomes increasingly critical in the visible and ultraviolet range, where our improved layers are expected to deliver enhanced performance.

Abstract: Silicon nitride microresonators have become an ubiquitous platform for cutting-edge photonics applications. Improvement in silicon nitride fabrication techniques, providing ultra-high quality-factor values up to $10^7$, has opened up new possibilities for nonlinear effects realizations in such structures. Here we report for the first time to our knowledge on the observation of the Stokes microcombs in silicon nitride on-chip microresonators exhibiting normal group velocity dispersion. Moreover, using different pump schemes, namely, a tunable laser with an isolator and a stabilized diode laser, we demonstrate on-chip stimulated Raman frequency combs including dark-pulse Raman states. We reveal a complex interplay between Kerr and Raman nonlinearities and elaborate effective method of controllable switching between predominantly Kerr-comb and predominantly Raman-comb operation. We prove the Raman-induced platicon formation by numerical model which shows perfect agreement with experimental results. These findings are of special importance for silicon nitride photonics and provide a basis for novel photonic devices.

Abstract: High-Altitude Platform Stations (HAPS) are emerging as key enablers of future non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), supporting gigabit-class free-space optical (FSO) backhaul links while hosting laser-based sensing payloads. This tutorial and survey reviews recent advances in HAPS optical communication and integration with atmospheric remote sensing via shared optical links. Among several sensing techniques, Differential Absorption Lidar (DIAL) is identified as most promising due to its range-resolved sensitivity, spectral selectivity, and compatibility with HAPS constraints. A roadmap is outlined for implementing telecom-band DIAL on HAPS alongside high-throughput FSO systems. The paper analyzes architectural and atmospheric advantages of HAPS over terrestrial and satellite nodes, emphasizing spatial-temporal coverage, station-keeping ability, and support for compact laser payloads such as DIAL, in-situ sensors, and multispectral imagers. It highlights the feasibility of co-locating sensing and communication within a shared optical and power envelope, especially in the telecom C-band (1.53-1.57 um), enabling trace-gas retrieval (CO2, CH4, N2O, H2S, O3) while maintaining multi-Gbps downlinks. Suitable HAPS architectures (balloons, UAVs, airships) and use cases are identified where integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-enabled HAPS outperform satellites and UAVs, including greenhouse gas monitoring, disaster response, air-quality mapping, and 6G NTN extensions. A literature survey for 2005-2025 shows HAPS publications have tripled since 2014, indicating rapid growth. The results confirm that optical hardware, favorable transmission windows, and active R&D are positioning HAPS as a persistent stratospheric layer for 6G ISAC communications and environmental observation.

Abstract: Optical links and knots have attracted growing attention owing to their exotic topologic features and promising applications in next-generation information transfer and storage. However, current protocols for optical topology realization rely on paraxial propagation of spatial modes, which inherently limits their three-dimensional topological structures to longitudinal space-filling. In this work we propose and experimentally demonstrate a scheme for creating optical knots and links that are localized in space within a transverse plane of a paraxial field, as well as in time. These spatiotemporal topological structures arise from polychromatic wave fields with tightly coupled spatial and temporal degrees of freedom that can be realized in the form of superpositions of toroidal light vortices of opposite topological charges. The (2+1)-dimensional nature of a toroidal light vortex imparts spatiotemporally localized wave fields with nontrivial topological textures, encompassing both individual and nested links or knots configurations. Moreover, the resulting topological textures are localized on an ultrashort timescale propagate at the group velocity of the wave packets and exhibit remarkable topological robustness during propagation as optical carriers. The nascent connection between spatiotemporally localized fields and topology offers exciting prospects for advancing space-time photonic topologies and exploring their potential applications in high-capacity informatics and communications.

### [5] [Broadband Achromatic Metalens for the Short-Wave Infrared](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06053)
*Yan He,Adetunmise Dada*

Main category: physics.optics

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于CaF2衬底的单条形硅纳米结构金属透镜设计，在1800-2300nm短波红外波段实现宽带色差抑制和稳定聚焦性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 短波红外1.8-2.3μm波段在量子传感、分子光谱和光通信中具有重要应用，但现有光学器件面临宽带色差和体积庞大难以集成的问题。

Method: 采用CaF2衬底上的单条形硅纳米结构，以900nm周期排列，通过精细调控条形长度和宽度实现色散补偿和相位调制。

Result: FDTD模拟显示该金属透镜在1800-2300nm范围内有效抑制色差，焦距变化小于焦距的6%，保持稳定聚焦性能。

Conclusion: 该设计为短波红外波段提供了一种紧凑、宽带、高性能的光束准直和波前整形解决方案，在量子通信和传感系统中具有应用潜力。

Abstract: The 1.8-2.3 μm band lies within the short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) region and serves as a key operational window for a wide range of applications, including quantum sensing, molecular spectroscopy, and free-space quantum and classical optical communication. Despite its significance, optical devices operating in this band still face two major challenges: chromatic aberration across the wide spectral range and the difficulty of integration due to bulky optical elements. Metalenses are composed of subwavelength nanostructures that locally control the phase and group delay of light, enabling precise wavefront shaping and broadband dispersion compensation. These capabilities make them highly promising for use in infrared optical systems, particularly in applications such as focusing and imaging for compact integrated devices. In this study, we propose a metalens design based on a CaF2 substrate, where each nanocell consists of a single-bar silicon structure. These nanocells are periodically arranged with a 900 nm period, enabling precise control of dispersion and phase. By systematically finetuning the bar length and width, the design enables simultaneous dispersion compensation and phase modulation, achieving stable focusing performance over a broad spectral range. Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) simulations demonstrate that the metalens design achieves effective suppression of chromatic aberration in the 1800-2300 nm range, maintaining a stable focal position throughout the bandwidth with variation within 6% of the focal length. This design offers a compact, broadband, and high-performance approach for beam collimation and wavefront shaping in the SWIR band, with promising potential for applications in quantum communication and sensing systems.

Abstract: The widespread use of lead-based materials in tandem solar cells raises critical environmental and health concerns due to their inherent toxicity and risk of contamination. To address this challenge, we focused on lead-free tandem architectures based on non-toxic, environmentally benign materials such as tin-based perovskites and kesterites, which are essential for advancing sustainable photovoltaic technologies. In this study, we present the proposition, design, and optimization of two distinct lead-free monolithic tandem solar cell architectures - an all-perovskite dual-junction device employing potassium tin iodide (KSnI3) and formamidinium tin triiodide (FASnI3) as absorbers for the top and bottom subcells, respectively, and a triple-junction monolithic tandem structure incorporating KSnI3, FASnI3, and Ag-doped copper zinc tin selenide (ACZTSe) as absorbers for the top, middle, and bottom subcells, respectively. We simulated the optical and electrical characteristics of these devices using the finite-difference time-domain and finite element methods, explicitly considering radiative, non-radiative, and surface recombination mechanisms. The optimized all-perovskite dual-junction solar cell achieved a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 27.3%, with short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 14.74 mA/cm2, open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 2.227 V, and fill factor (FF) of 83.14%. Conversely, the optimized triple-junction hybrid perovskite-kesterite architecture secured an elevated PCE of 30.69%, along with Jsc of 13.184 mA/cm2, Voc of 2.766 V, and FF of 84.18%. These findings reveal the strong potential of lead-free perovskite and kesterite material based absorbers in promoting high-performance hybrid tandem solar cells, highlighting their importance in advancing sustainable and efficient photovoltaic technologies.

Conclusion: MASI将棘手的光学同步问题转化为计算问题，实现了光学波长下可扩展合成孔径系统的实际部署。

Abstract: Synthetic aperture imaging has enabled breakthrough observations from radar to astronomy. However, optical implementation remains challenging due to stringent wavefield synchronization requirements among multiple receivers. Here we present the multiscale aperture synthesis imager (MASI), which utilizes parallelism to break complex optical challenges into tractable sub-problems. MASI employs a distributed array of coded sensors that operate independently yet coherently to surpass the diffraction limit of single receiver. It combines the propagated wavefields from individual sensors through a computational phase synchronization scheme, eliminating the need for overlapping measurement regions to establish phase coherence. Light diffraction in MASI naturally expands the imaging field, generating phase-contrast visualizations that are substantially larger than sensor dimensions. Without using lenses, MASI resolves sub-micron features at ultralong working distances and reconstructs 3D shapes over centimeter-scale fields. MASI transforms the intractable optical synchronization problem into a computational one, enabling practical deployment of scalable synthetic aperture systems at optical wavelengths.

Abstract: We propose a novel class of gaseous diffractive optical elements created by imprinting an entropy mode in a gas. Previous approaches to gaseous diffractive optics relied on the simultaneous excitation of a standing acoustic wave and an entropy mode to produce one-dimensional periodic structures. However, the presence of acoustic oscillations in the gas imposes stringent constraints on some operational parameters of these optical elements, such as their lifetime and diffraction angle. In this work, we introduce a new approach that eliminates the acoustic mode, relying solely on the entropy mode. This enables control of the lifetime and temporal profile of gaseous optical elements, and also allows the creation of arbitrary structures with greater contrast, including non-periodic patterns such as chirped gratings or lenses. This approach should allow operation over a wider parameter space, including larger diffraction angles and compatibility with laser pulse durations ranging from femtoseconds to microseconds.

Conclusion: 该理论将傅里叶光学与超分辨率技术结合，使实验设备更简单、更鲁棒。

Abstract: Resolving sources beyond the diffraction limit is important in imaging, communications, and metrology. Current image-based methods of super-resolution require phase information (either of the source points or an added filter) and perfect alignment with the centroid of the object. Both inhibit the practical application of these methods, as uniform motion and/or relative jitter destroy their assumptions. Here, we show that measuring intensity in the Fourier plane enables super-resolution without any of the issues of image-based methods. We start with the shift-invariance of the Fourier transform and the observation that the two-point position problem ${x_1,x_2}$ in the near field corresponds to the single-point wavenumber problem $k\ =2π/(x_2-x_1)$ in the far field. We consider the full range of mutual coherence and show that for fully coherent sources, the Fourier method saturates the quantum limit, i.e. it gives the best possible measurement. Similar results hold for sub-Rayleigh constellations of N sources, which can act collectively as a spatially averaged metasurface and/or individually as elements of a phased-array antenna. The theory paves the way to merge Fourier optics with super-resolution techniques, enabling experimental devices that are both simpler and more robust than previous designs.

Abstract: The mesoscale characterization of biological specimens has traditionally required compromises between resolution, field-of-view, depth-of-field, and molecular specificity, with most approaches relying on external labels. Here we present the Deep-ultrAviolet ptychogRaphic pockeT-scope (DART), a handheld platform that transforms label-free molecular imaging through intrinsic deep-ultraviolet spectroscopic contrast. By leveraging biomolecules' natural absorption fingerprints and combining them with lensless ptychographic microscopy, DART resolves down to 308-nm linewidths across centimeter-scale areas while maintaining millimeter-scale depth-of-field. The system's virtual error-bin methodology effectively eliminates artifacts from limited temporal coherence and other optical imperfections, enabling high-fidelity molecular imaging without lenses. Through differential spectroscopic imaging at deep-ultraviolet wavelengths, DART quantitatively maps nucleic acid and protein distributions with femtogram sensitivity, providing an intrinsic basis for explainable virtual staining. We demonstrate DART's capabilities through molecular imaging of tissue sections, cytopathology specimens, blood cells, and neural populations, revealing detailed molecular contrast without external labels. The combination of high-resolution molecular mapping and broad mesoscale imaging in a portable platform opens new possibilities from rapid clinical diagnostics, tissue analysis, to biological characterization in space exploration.

Abstract: Achieving gigapixel space-bandwidth products (SBP) at video rates represents a fundamental challenge in imaging science. Here we demonstrate video-rate ptychography that overcomes this barrier by exploiting spatiotemporal correlations through neural field representations. Our approach factorizes the space-time volume into low-rank spatial and temporal features, transforming SBP scaling from sequential measurements to efficient correlation extraction. The architecture employs dual networks for decoding real and imaginary field components, avoiding phase-wrapping discontinuities plagued in amplitude-phase representations. A gradient-domain loss on spatial derivatives ensures robust convergence. We demonstrate video-rate gigapixel imaging with centimeter-scale coverage while resolving 308-nm linewidths. Validations span from monitoring sample dynamics of crystals, bacteria, stem cells, microneedle to characterizing time-varying probes in extreme ultraviolet experiments, demonstrating versatility across wavelengths. By transforming temporal variations from a constraint into exploitable correlations, we establish that gigapixel video is tractable with single-sensor measurements, making ptychography a high-throughput sensing tool for monitoring mesoscale dynamics without lenses.

Abstract: Dielectric resonant metasurfaces can be utilized for efficient high harmonic generation, which has been explored here in this effort for a high-efficient Germanium metasurface for upconverted full-Stokes imaging at 1.33-micron wavelength by the third harmonic generation (THG) from the 4-micron fundamental wavelength. The internal TH conversion efficiency for the Ge film is about 1x10-5 % to 5.6x10-3 % and for the Ge-metasurface 1.5x10-4 % to 1.05x10-1 % for linearly polarized (LP) incidence, and 1.3x10-4 % to 6.1x10-2 % for circularly polarized (CP) incidence, for the optical intensity range 0.47 GW/cm2 to 16.8 GW/cm2 respectively. The effect of the Ge film height variation has been discussed and compared with transmission line theory for the nonlinear medium. The metasurface design pitch is suitably tuned for the anisotropic cross-triangles nanoantenna for analyzing the polarization states of the fundamental beam simultaneously. The effect of source intensity on TH conversion among the LP and CP states, flipping the nonlinear diffraction orders and incipient of new harmonics with intensity dependence and design limitations, has also been addressed. To my knowledge, with this type of metasurface design, this is the first approach for upconverted full-Stokes imaging. The benefit will be upconverted polarimetry of MWIR at SWIR, where uncooled efficient detectors are available for high-resolution thermal imaging. This efficient Ge-metasurface is exempt from TH transmission loss due to the size effect of assigning a phase gradient for polarization-dependent TH diffraction order generation and orthogonal transmission disparity. Integration of this type of metasurface for infrared image upconversion will open new possibilities for intense heat signature identification, especially for target recognition in next-generation infrared homing devices in surveillance and missile defense systems.

Abstract: Semiconductor lasers merge coherent light emission with photodetection and, owing to third-order nonlinearities in their active region, function as sensitive room temperature two-photon absorption (TPA) detectors. Here, we leverage these capabilities offered by a commercially available InGaAsP semiconductor laser diode with an integrated InGaAs monitor photodiode to measure the duration of femtosecond pulses at telecom wavelengths.

Abstract: Twistronics, the study of moiré superlattices of twisted bilayer 2D materials creating nontrivial physical effects, has recently revolutionized diverse subjects from materials to optoelectronics, nanophotonics, and beyond. Here, breaking the reliance on materials, we present twistronics in higher-dimensional free space, where the twisted lattice is not a layer of 2D material but a 3D propagating light field with topological textures. Moiré structured light with a twist angle can generate a rich set of high-dimensional topologies, including skyrmionium bags, skyrmion bag superlattices, skyrmion clusters, and optical quasicrystals, with controllable symmetry. Many of these textures have not been reported before. Importantly, in contrast to prior moiré superlattices, our freespace optical moiré textures maintain their topologies over a long propagation distances, showing nondiffractive behavior and robustness against perturbations and obstacles. Our work unlocks higher dimensions to manipulate moiré photonics with high-capacity topologies to address modern challenges of robust information transfer and encryption.

Abstract: Integrated radio-frequency (RF) photonics plays a pivotal role in wireless communications, sensing, and radar due to its large intrinsic bandwidth, remote distribution capability, and compact footprint. However, despite significant advances in photonic integrated circuits (PICs), the practical deployment of these systems remains constrained by the bulky nature of essential RF components (e.g., bulky antennas, amplifiers, and cables), especially in covert, conformal, and space-constrained applications. To overcome these limitations, monolithic electronic-photonic integrated circuits (EPICs), enabling miniaturized and synergistic integration of both RF and photonic components, are gaining notable attention. As a groundbreaking advancement, we demonstrate a novel photonic RF receiver that monolithically integrates a bow-tie antenna and a microring modulator on a thin-film lithium niobate platform. The chip innovatively leverages dual-resonance enhancement mechanism, RF resonance from the antenna and optical resonance from the microring, to significantly boost the RF-to-optical conversion efficiency. A record-high figure of merit (FOM) of 3.88 W-1/2 is achieved within a compact footprint of 2*1.7 mm2. As the first demonstrations, the integrated receiver is deployed in an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, achieving centimeter-level radar ranging accuracy and 3.2 Gbps wireless communication capacity, as well as real-time video transmission function in moving scenarios. This seminal work paves a new way for covert, conformal, and miniaturized frontends in wireless communication and sensing applications, including body area networks, unmanned aerial vehicles, high-speed vacuum maglevs, and electronic warfare systems.

Abstract: The resolving ability of wide-field fluorescence microscopy is fundamentally limited by out-of-focus background owing to its low axial resolution, particularly for densely labeled biological samples. To address this, we developed ET2dNet, a deep learning-based EPI-TIRF cross-modality network that achieves TIRF-comparable background subtraction and axial super-resolution from a single wide-field image without requiring hardware modifications. The model employs a physics-informed hybrid architecture, synergizing supervised learning with registered EPI-TIRF image pairs and self-supervised physical modeling via convolution with the point spread function. This framework ensures exceptional generalization across microscope objectives, enabling few-shot adaptation to new imaging setups. Rigorous validation on cellular and tissue samples confirms ET2dNet's superiority in background suppression and axial resolution enhancement, while maintaining compatibility with deconvolution techniques for lateral resolution improvement. Furthermore, by extending this paradigm through knowledge distillation, we developed ET3dNet, a dedicated three-dimensional reconstruction network that produces artifact-reduced volumetric results. ET3dNet effectively removes out-of-focus background signals even when the input image stack lacks the source of background. This framework makes axial super-resolution imaging more accessible by providing an easy-to-deploy algorithm that avoids additional hardware costs and complexity, showing great potential for live cell studies and clinical histopathology.

Abstract: Soliton microcombs generated in optical microresonators are accelerating the transition of optical frequency combs from laboratory instruments to industrial platforms. Self injection locking (SIL) enables direct driving of soliton microcombs by integrated lasers, providing turnkey initiation and improved coherence, but it also pins the pump close to resonance, limiting both spectral span and tuning flexibility. Here we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate that introducing a thermally tunable auxiliary microresonator extends the bandwidth of SIL soliton microcombs. By engineering hybridization of the pumped resonance, we achieve deterministic access to single soliton states and then push operation into a far detuned regime inaccessible to direct initiation. The resulting combs reach a near 200 nm span at a 25 GHz repetition rate, while preserving the SIL-enabled noise suppression throughout. Moreover, the added degree of freedom afforded by the coupled resonator architecture enables orthogonal control of the comb's repetition rate and center frequency. These advances expand the spectral reach and controllability of integrated soliton microcombs for information processing and precision metrology.

Abstract: Ultrafast permittivity modulation in epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) media provides a pathway for real-time control of non-Hermitian photonic topology. We model ultrafast topological dynamics in an ITO/SiO$_2$/Ag multilayer supporting hybrid epsilon-near-zero (ENZ)-plasmon modes. Using a time-dependent Drude-Lorentz permittivity for ITO and rigorous coupled-wave analysis, it is found that carrier relaxation with a 10-ps time constant redshifts the ENZ resonance from 490 to 525~nm and shifts the reflection-phase singularities across the angle--wavelength plane. The motion of these singularities corresponds to the displacement of exceptional points and a discrete change in the cumulative winding number. The transient Floquet-like band structure exhibits avoided crossings and Dirac-type dispersions driven by ENZ modulation. The results directly link picosecond-scale permittivity dynamics to quantized topological transitions in non-Hermitian photonic systems.

Abstract: Precise light delivery through biological tissue is essential for deep-tissue imaging and phototherapeutic applications. Wavefront shaping enables control over scattered light by modulating the incident wavefront, but its application in living tissue is hindered by tissue-induced temporal decorrelation. This study systematically investigated the real-valued intensity transmission matrix (RVITM), a high-speed wavefront shaping method, for light focusing across a broad range of speckle decorrelation times. The inherent trade-off between static light focusing enhancement and implementation speed is characterized, which provided practical guidelines for implementing RVITM in real-time wavefront shaping under varying dynamic conditions. Effective optical focusing using a RVITM with 33 ms runtime was achieved through porcine liver with decorrelation times as short as 13 ms, demonstrating feasibility for biologically relevant dynamics and supporting the development of adaptive, non-invasive optical control for biomedical applications.

Abstract: A novel idea, Quantum Thermodynamic Transformation Optics (QTTO), is introduced in this article. This theoretical framework integrates the geometric formalism of transformation optics with the thermodynamic principles found in quantum dissipative systems. This concept goes beyond traditional coordinate transformations by affecting the distribution of quantum energy and entropy in a coherent thermodynamic manner as well as reshaping electromagnetic fields. By employing the thermofield dynamics approach, we establish new rules that show how local energy and entropy densities are influenced by the Jacobian determinant of the mapping. This indicates that when the geometry is compressed, it increases the generation of quantum energy and entropy density, while expansion has the opposite effect, all while adhering to the laws of conservation and the second law of thermodynamics.
  As a practical test, we reformulate the Casimir effect within this framework, yielding a continuous pressure law that connects the quantum and classical realms via a thermal weighting function. This relationship illustrates how both geometry and temperature jointly determine quantum pressure. Additionally, our numerical results for Drude-Lorentz metamaterials support our analytical predictions and align closely with the comprehensive Lifshitz-Matsubara formulation. In fact, QTTO offers a powerful and coherent platform for exploring energy, entropy, and quantum pressure in real-world dissipative media. Beyond our immediate findings, it opens up a systematic pathway for managing quantum thermal processes and controlling field fluctuations in metamaterials and curved optical environments.

Abstract: We demonstrate Fano-like resonances in silicon-on-insulator (SOI) nanowire-based coupled Sagnac interferometers (SIs) formed by a self-coupled waveguide. By adjusting the reflectivity of the two SIs and coupling strength between them, we tailor coherent mode interference to achieve high-performance optical analogues of Fano resonance. The device is theoretically analyzed and experimentally fabricated on a SOI platform. Theoretical analysis predicts periodic Fano-like resonances with a high extinction ratio and a steep slope rate, arising from strong coherent optical mode interference within a compact resonator comprising two SIs and a connected feedback waveguide. Experimental results align with the theoretical model, validating the expected resonance behavior and confirming the effectiveness of the design. These findings underscore the potential of compact coupled SIs for generating Fano-like resonances, enabling broader applications in integrated photonics.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian physics can be used to break time reversal symmetry and is important for interactions in a wide range of systems, from active matter and neural networks to metamaterials and non-equilibrium thermodynamics. In integrated photonic devices, non-Hermitian physics can be used for direction-dependent light propagation, reconfigurable light paths, selective energy localization and optical isolators. In this work, we report previously unexplored direction-dependent mode splitting in ring microresonators, achieved by adding multiple scatterers around the cavity. Through experiments, simulations, and theoretical modeling, we unveil the underlying physics that changes the resonance shapes in resonant systems with backscattering. By engineering the spatial configuration of the scatterers, we can produce a predictable and repeatable direction-dependent mode splitting, enabling new ways to route light through optical resonators and photonic networks. In addition, the direction dependent mode-splitting can be used for precise near-field measurements, enhancing traditional sensing in integrated photonic chips.

Abstract: The geometric phase is a universal concept in modern physics and has enabled the development of metasurfaces for versatile wavefront shaping. However, its realization in metasurfaces has been restricted to circularly polarized light, confining geometric phase metasurfaces to helicity-dependent operation and excluding them from the linear-polarization domain that dominates modern optics. In this work, we overcome this limitation by harnessing exceptional points of non-Hermitian physics. We introduce and experimentally realize quasi-exceptional-point metasurfaces that exploit engineered singularities to directly impart a geometric phase onto linearly polarized light. Proof-of-principle demonstrations with gratings and holograms confirm broadband and high-fidelity wavefront shaping across arbitrary linear polarizations, which has not been achieved with previous phase modulation approaches. By revealing an intrinsic connection between geometric phase and non-Hermitian photonics, our work resolves a long-standing theoretical impasse and establishes a new framework for high-dimensional light control, opening opportunities for scalable polarization optics, advanced imaging, holography, optical communications, and integrated photonics.

Abstract: Random lasers (RL) emit light through multiple scattering in disordered gain media, typically resulting in isotropic emission with limited directionality control. Controlling RL emission direction in compact systems remains a challenge. Here we report directional random lasing achieved by infiltrating dye-doped nematic liquid crystals into a nanostructured silica metasurface. By adjusting pump energy, we induce a transition from uniform angular photoluminescence to a strongly directional emission peak at large angles in the amplified spontaneous emission and RL regimes. This directionality arises from enhanced spatial coherence in the strong scattering regime, enabling coupling of guided random-laser modes to high-angle diffraction through the metasurface grating. Our system demonstrates wide-angle RL beam steering at submicron scale without complex external components. These results provide a straightforward method to control RL emission directionality, advancing tunable coherent light sources and metasurface-based photonic applications.

Abstract: Designing large-scale metasurfaces with nonlocal optical effects remains challenging due to the immense dimensionality and fabrication constraints of conventional optimization methods. We introduce GiBS (Generative Input-side Basis-driven Structures), an inverse-design framework that represents the entire device using a compact set of coefficients from smooth parametric bases such as Fourier or Chebyshev functions. This formulation compresses the design space by more than an order of magnitude, enabling efficient optimization of complex, broadband, and aperiodic geometries. GiBS integrates this low-dimensional representation with an autoencoder-based manifold-learning workflow to map the relationship between geometry and optical response, facilitating rapid exploration, discovery of high-performance designs, and systematic analysis of fabrication sensitivity. The inherent smoothness of the basis functions ensures manufacturability while capturing the asymmetry required for nonlocal optical interactions. We experimentally validated the framework through the realization of a PEDOT:PSS broadband scattering metasurface, whose measured response closely matched full-wave simulations across 500-1100 nm. These results establish GiBS as a scalable, data-efficient, and fabrication-aware platform for the inverse design of multifunctional metasurfaces, bridging AI-guided representation learning with experimentally realizable photonic architectures.

Abstract: We investigate the dynamical formation of nonlinear patterns in one-dimensional ring condensates under bichromatic periodic modulation of the interaction strength. The stability phase diagram of the condensate's homogeneous density state is analytically derived through a suitable biharmonic variant of the Mathieu equation and computing the associated Floquet spectrum. It reveals the complex interplay between the driving parameters, i.e., amplitude, frequencies, and the so-called frequencies' mixing angle, which dictate the instability onset and the selective enhancement of higher-order resonance tongues, thus offering precise control over the excited modes. These results are in agreement with time-dependent mean-field simulations evidencing the emergence of density wave modulations of specific momenta, while enabling a deeper understanding of the nonlinear stage of the relevant instability. Further insights on the ensuing unstable nonlinear dynamics are provided through a reduced {five-mode} model which captures the instability onset, the oscillatory behavior of the mode populations and the phase-space dynamics, in agreement with the mean-field predictions. Our study highlights the versatility of bichromatic driving to generate and control complex nonlinear patterns that are within reach in present day ultracold atom experiments.

Abstract: We propose an ac-driven atomic Josephson junction as a clean and tunable source of three dimensional (3D) solitary waves in quantum fluids. Depending on the height of the junction barrier, the emitted excitations appear as vortex rings at low velocity or vorticity-free rarefaction pulses near the sound velocity, thus spanning the complete Jones-Roberts family of solitons. The Shapiro-step phenomenon renders the emission deterministic: on the first, second, third Shapiro steps, the junction ejects one, two, and three solitary excitations per drive cycle. This enables controlled generation of single- and multi-excitation configurations, allowing detailed studies of the full crossover between vortex rings and rarefaction pulses and their interaction dynamics. In particular, deterministic multi-ring emission provides insights into leapfrogging dynamics of two and three coaxial rings and their decay via boundary-assisted, sound-mediated processes. This ac-driven protocol establishes a compact and reproducible platform for generating, classifying, and controlling 3D solitonic excitations, paving the way for precision studies of nonlinear vortex dynamics, dissipation, and quantum turbulence in trapped superfluids.

Abstract: We design an atomtronic filter device that spatially separates the components of a two-component Fermi gas with repulsive contact interactions in a two-dimensional geometry. With the aid of density--potential functional theory (DPFT), which can accurately simulate Fermi gases in realistic settings, we propose and characterize a barbell-shaped trapping potential, where a bridge-shaped potential connects two ring-shaped potentials. In the strongly repulsive regime, each of the ring traps eventually stores one of the fermion species. Our simulations are a guide to designing component filters for initially mixed, weakly repulsive spin components. We demonstrate that the functioning of this barbell design is robust against variations in experimental settings, for example, across particle numbers, for small deformations of the trap geometry, or if interatomic interactions differ from the bare contact repulsion. Our investigation marks the first step in establishing DPFT as a comprehensive simulation framework for fermionic atomtronics.

Abstract: The ability to preserve multipartite entanglement in noisy environments is central to advancing quantum information processing. In this work, we develop a semiclassical theoretical model of three entangled qubits exposed to local Markov noise environments with tunable statistical correlations between noise sources. We show that such correlations can significantly influence the dynamics of multipartite entanglement, in some cases slowing its decay and, under ideal conditions, even enabling full preservation. Using tripartite negativity as an entanglement measure, we derive analytical results for the GHZ and W states, demonstrating their contrasting responses to correlated and anticorrelated noise. Our analysis identifies regimes in which multipartite entanglement can be sustained despite environmental interactions, offering new insight into how noise correlations may serve as a resource for protecting quantum coherence in multi-qubit systems.

Abstract: Biphoton states have shown promising applications in quantum information processing, including quantum communications, quantum metrology, and quantum imaging. The generation and manipulation of biphoton entanglement in topologically distinct modes paves the way in this direction. Here we present a comprehensive method for regulating the topological properties of the system by combining the nonlinearity in waveguides, i.e., nonlinearity in the waveguide coupling materials, and the waveguide lattice structure. Our method enables the generation of topological biphoton states with injected pump activation on the topologically trivial modes. This is realized through self-induced manipulation on pump-dependent nonlinear couplings on the defects, which is unable to be realized while there are no such nonlinear couplings. Specifically, by including the nonlinear gain/loss mechanism in the coupling between the nearest-neighbor waveguides and the third-order Kerr nonlinearity effect along the waveguides, the injected pump power will be the controllable parameter for the manipulation of the topology in the defect states and the generation of biphoton entanglement states. We also present an experimental proposal to realize our scheme and its generalization in the contemporaneous "active" topological photonics time-bin platforms. Our method can be used in other Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) models with various defect configurations. Our method enables the reusability and versatility of SSH lattice chips and their application for fault-tolerant quantum information processing, promoting the industrialization process of quantum technology.

Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of number entropy in a chain of free fermions subjected to both defects and stochastic processes. For a special class of defects, namely conformal defects, we present analytical and numerical results for the temporal growth of number entropy, the time evolution of the number distribution, and the eigenvalue profile of the associated correlation matrix within a subsystem. We show that the number entropy exhibits logarithmic growth in time, originating from the Gaussian structure of the number distribution. We find that the eigenvalue dynamics reveal a profound connection to the reflection and transmission coefficients of the associated scattering problem for a broad range of defects. When stochastic processes are introduced, specifically Stochastic Unitary Processes (SUP) and Quantum State Diffusion (QSD), the number entropy scales as $\ln(t)$ in the SUP case and shows strong hints of $\ln [\ln(t)]$ scaling in the QSD case. These findings establish compelling evidence that number entropy grows logarithmically slower than the corresponding von Neumann entanglement entropy across a wide class of systems.

Abstract: Model predictive control has shown potential to enhance the robustness of quantum control systems. propose a tractable Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) framework for finite-dimensional quantum systems under continuous-time measurement and quantum filtering. Using the almost-sure eigenstate reduction of quantum trajectories, we prove that the infinite-horizon stochastic objective collapses to a fidelity term that is computable in closed form from the one-step averaged state. Consequently, the online SMPC step requires only deterministic propagation of the filter and a terminal fidelity evaluation. An advantage of this method is that it eliminates per-horizon Monte Carlo scenario sampling and significantly reduces computational load while retaining the essential stochastic dynamics. We establish equivalence and mean-square stability guarantees, and validate the approach on multi-level and Ising-type systems, demonstrating favorable scalability compared to sampling-based SMPC.

Abstract: We investigate the relationships among the wave property, particle property and mixedness of quantum states based on the lp-norm coherence. By conforming that the lp-norm coherence is an appropriate measure of wave property and introducing a measure of particle property based on the differences between the maximal l2-norm coherence and the general l2-norm coherence, we present tradeoff relationships among the wave, particle and mixedness of quantum states. For 1<= p <2, we establish two kinds of tradeoffs of the wave, particle and mixedness with respect to the upper and lower bounds of the lp-norm coherence given by the l2-norm coherence. These trade relations give rise to compressive understanding of the intrinsic connections among the wave, particle and mixedness of quantum states, and cover some existing results as particular ones.

Conclusion: Petz恢复映射在所考虑的恢复协议中接近最优，并提供了其物理直觉解释。

Abstract: Optical systems are a main platform for quantum information processing, while a hidden challenge in these systems is information loss due to scattering into unmonitored modes, typically modeled as state-independent beam-splitter interactions. While such losses simply erase information encoded across modes, they directly degrade information encoded in the quantum state of a mode. Perfect correction of these Gaussian lossy channels with Gaussian operations alone is known to be impossible. In this work, we investigate the Petz recovery map as an approximate recovery. We construct the Petz recovery of single mode losses and its implementations. In particular, we show that the recovery performance of Petz recovery map is better than the recovery protocol that replaces the noisy state with the belief state. Also, when the reference state is far from the true state, it is better not to use the Petz recovery map but to leave the noisy state instead. We discuss the physical intuition of Petz recovery map and finally shows that it is near-optimal among the considered recovery protocols.

Abstract: The quantum speed limit sets a fundamental restriction on the evolution time of quantum systems. We explore the relationship between quantum imaginarity and the quantum speed limit by utilizing measures such as relative entropy, trace distance, and geometric imaginarity. These speed limits define the fundamental constraints on the minimum time necessary for quantum systems to evolve under various dynamical processes. As applications the dephasing dynamics and dissipative dynamics are analyzed in detail. The quantum speed limit in stochastic-approximate transformations is also investigated. Our quantum speed limits provide lower bounds on how fast a physical system evolves to attain or lose certain imaginarity, with potential applications in efficient quantum computation designs, quantum control and quantum sensing.

Abstract: Quantum technologies with quantum correlated light require photodiodes with near-perfect `true' quantum efficiency, the definition of which adequately accounts for the photodiode dark noise. Future squeezed-light-enhanced gravitational wave detectors could in principle achieve higher sensitivities with a longer laser wavelength around 2 μm. Photodiodes made of extended InGaAs are available for this range, but the true quantum efficiency at room temperature and the low frequency band of gravitational waves is strongly reduced by dark noise. Here we characterize the change in performance of a commercial extended-InGaAs photodiode versus temperature. While the dark noise decreases as expected with decreasing temperature, the detection efficiency unfortunately also decreases monotonically. Our results indicate the need for a dedicated new design of photodiodes for gravitational wave detectors using 2-μm laser light.

Abstract: The definition of quantum states in terms of tagged vector spaces is generalized to incorporate the spatiotemporal and spin degrees of freedom. Considering a tagged vector space where the index space is a function space, representing the additional degrees of freedom, we obtained axioms for the tags that include a completeness condition expressed in terms of a functional integral with an abstract functional integration measure. Using these axioms, we derive a generating functional for the moments of this functional integration measure. These moments are then used to evaluate the functional integrals of Gaussian functionals, leading to expressions in accordance with those obtained as generalizations of equivalent integrals over a finite number of integration variables. For a Gaussian functional used as a probability distributions, we show that its moments, obtained with this functional integration measure, satisfy Carleman's condition, indicating that the measure is unique.

The power of doing so is illustrated by the variety of scientific areas we apply it to: permutational quantum computing, quantum machine learning, condensed matter physics, and quantum gravity. Respectively, we analyse permutational computing transition amplitudes, evaluate barren plateaus for SU(2) symmetric ansätze, study properties of AKLT states, and derive the minimum quantised volume in loop quantum gravity.
  Our starting point is the mixed-dimensional ZX calculus, a purely diagrammatic language that has been proven to be complete for finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. That is, any equation that can be derived in the Hilbert space formalism, can also be derived in the mixed-dimensional ZX calculus. We embed the Spin-ZX calculus inside the mixed-dimensional ZX calculus, rendering it a quantum information flavoured diagrammatic language for the quantum theory of angular momentum, i.e. SU(2) representation theory. We diagrammatically derive the fundamental spin coupling objects - such as Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, symmetrising mappings between qubits and spin spaces, and spin Hamiltonians - under this embedding.
  Our results establish the Spin-ZX calculus as a powerful tool for representing and computing with SU(2) systems graphically, offering new insights into foundational relationships and paving the way for new diagrammatic algorithms for theoretical physics.

Motivation: 解决非对易算符测量精度受限的问题，同时保持全局对称性，探索贝尔不等式违反的新机制。

Method: 将测量误差解释为改变隐变量的测度空间，构建局域隐变量模型，违反统计独立性假设。

Result: 模型能够违反贝尔不等式，且与量子力学给出微妙不同的预测，可通过实验验证。

Conclusion: 提供了一种无需超决定论或逆因果性的贝尔不等式违反机制，为隐变量理论提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: The precision with which we can measure operators that do not commute with conserved quantities is limited by the need to preserve the associated global symmetries. We show how to construct a local hidden-variable model that violates Bell inequalities by interpreting this measurement error as altering the measure space of the hidden variables. This provides a physically-motivated example of a supermeasured model, where the statistical independence assumption used to form Bell inequalities is violated without there being a causal dependence of the measurement settings on the hidden variables (superdeterminism) or a causal dependence of the hidden variables on the measurement settings (retrocausality). The model also gives subtly different predictions to quantum mechanics, that could be tested experimentally.

Abstract: Heat engines convert thermal energy into mechanical work. We here report the experimental realization of a fully quantum engine that converts quantum coherence into work. A single solid-state spin in diamond is fueled by a coherent bath and cyclically stores energy in a spin quantum battery. We establish quantum-enhanced performance by showing that almost 200$\%$ more work is produced after a few cycle compared to the corresponding classical engine. We obtain concrete criteria for successful coherence-to-work conversion, and highlight the importance of a coherent motor-battery interaction. This device harnesses nonclassical features during all stages of its cycle, and demonstrates the functionality of a nanomachine whose parts are all quantum coherent.

Motivation: 在量子信息处理的物理实现中，Lambda型系统的量子比特通过不稳定的高能级间接耦合，该能级更容易发生退相干，因此需要优化控制策略来最小化高能级占据。

Conclusion: 所提出的几何控制技术可以适应其他量子系统，有望将几何控制在量子系统中的应用推向更重要的水平。

Abstract: In various physical implementations of quantum information processing, qubits are realized in a Lambda type system configuration as two stable lower energy levels coupled indirectly via an unstable higher energy level, that is, in comparison, a lot more susceptible to decoherence. We consider the quantum control problem of optimal state transfer between two isospectral density matrices, over an arbitrary finite time horizon, for the quantum Lambda system. The cost considered is a compromise between the energy of the control field and the average occupancy in the highest energy level. We apply a geometric approach that combines the use of the Pontryagin Maximum Principle, a symmetry reduction technique to reduce the number of parameters in the resulting optimization problem, and several auxiliary techniques to bound the parameter space in the search for the optimal solution. We prove several properties of the optimal control and trajectories for this problem, including their normality and smoothness. We obtain a system of differential equations that must be satisfied by the optimal pair of control and trajectory we treat in detail, with numerical simulations, and solve a case study involving a Hadamard-like transformation. Our techniques can be adapted to other contexts and promise to push to a more consequential level, the application of geometric control in quantum systems.

Motivation: 开发能够同时抵抗损耗和退相干噪声的实用玻色子量子纠错码，为量子计算硬件提供即用型纠错解决方案。

Method: 构建旋转对称的压缩真空态叠加码，使用Hadamard-条件压缩-Hadamard序列和条件旋转序列制备编码态，通过Knill-Laflamme违例函数评估性能。

Result: 随着码中压缩真空态数量m的增加，损耗容错性提高但退相干敏感性也增加，性能优于猫态码，在现有量子平台上可实现。

Conclusion: 压缩真空码是实用、硬件就绪的玻色子纠错码家族，为量子计算提供了有前景的纠错方案。

Abstract: We introduce a family of bosonic quantum error-correcting codes built as a rotation-symmetric superposition of squeezed vacuum states, which promise protection against both loss and dephasing noise channels. The robustness of these "squeezed-vacuum codes" arises from being arranged at evenly spaced angles in phase-space, and simultaneously in evenly spaced photon-number support $n \equiv {2k} \! \pmod {2m}$. We present simple preparation circuits: a two-legged code using a Hadamard-conditional-squeezing-Hadamard sequence on an ancilla qubit, and for general "$m$-legged" codewords using sequences of conditional rotations. The performance of these codes is evaluated against loss and dephasing noises using the Knill-Laflamme violation function and benchmarked against cat codes. As the number $m$ of squeezed-vacuum states in a code increases, the code exhibits improved loss tolerance at the cost of higher dephasing sensitivity. We outline implementations in circuit QED and trapped-ion platforms, where high-fidelity Gaussian operations and conditional controls are available or under active development. These results help establish squeezed-vacuum codes as practical, hardware-ready, members of the bosonic codes class.

Conclusion: 该工作为在量子LDPC码中实现可寻址逻辑操作提供了有效方案，支持通用量子计算，具有恒定时间开销的优势。

Abstract: Quantum computing relies on quantum error correction for high-fidelity logical operations, but scaling to achieve near-term quantum utility is highly resource-intensive. High-rate quantum LDPC codes can reduce error correction overhead, yet realizing high-rate fault-tolerant computation with these codes remains a central challenge. Apart of the lattice surgery approach, standard schemes for realizing logical gates have so far been restricted to performing global operations on all logical qubits at the same time. Another approach relies on low-rate code switching methods. In this work, we introduce a gate-based protocol for addressable single- and multi-qubit Clifford operations on individual logical qubits encoded within one or more quantum LDPC codes. Our scheme leverages logical transversal operations via an auxiliary Bacon-Shor code to perform logical operations with constant time overhead enabled by teleportation. We demonstrate the implementation of an overcomplete logical Clifford gate set and perform numerical simulations to evaluate the error-correction performance of our protocol. Finally, we observe that our scheme can be integrated with magic state cultivation protocols to achieve universal, gate-based, and fully addressable quantum computation.

Conclusion: 新振幅公式不仅改进了Clifford电路模拟，还为局部Clifford等价图态表征和低秩邻接矩阵图态学习提供了新工具。

Abstract: Quantum circuits are considered more powerful than classical circuits and require exponential resources to simulate classically. Clifford circuits are a special class of quantum circuits that can be simulated in polynomial time but still show important quantum effects such as entanglement. In this work, we present an algorithm that simulates Clifford circuits by performing Gaussian elimination on a modified adjacency matrix derived from the circuit structure. Our work builds on an ZX-calculus tensor network representation of Clifford circuits that reduces to quantum graph states. We give a concise formula of amplitudes of graph states based on the LDL decomposition of matrices over GF(2), and use it to get efficient algorithms for strong and weak simulation of Clifford circuits using tree-decomposition-based fast LDL algorithm. The complexity of our algorithm matches the state of art for weak graph state simulation and improves the state of art for strong graph state simulation by taking advantage of Strassen-like fast matrix multiplication. Our algorithm is also efficient when computing many amplitudes or samples of a Clifford circuit. Further, our amplitudes formula provides a new characterization of locally Clifford equivalent graph states as well as an efficient protocol to learn graph states with low-rank adjacency matrices.

Abstract: Optical neural networks (ONNs) have been developed to enhance processing speed and energy efficiency in machine learning by leveraging optical devices for nonlinear activation and establishing connections among neurons. In this work, we propose a quantum optical neural network (QONN) that utilizes atom-cavity neurons with controllable photon absorption and emission. These quantum neurons are designed to replace the electronic components in ONNs, which typically introduce delays and substantial energy consumption during nonlinear activation. To evaluate the performance of the QONN, we apply it to the MNIST digit classification task, considering the effects of photon absorption duration, random atom-cavity detuning, and stochastic photon loss. Additionally, we introduce a convolutional QONN to facilitate a real-world satellite image classification (SAT-6) task. Due to its compact hardware and low power consumption, the QONN offers a promising solution for real-time satellite sensing, reducing communication bandwidth with ground stations and thereby enhancing data security.

Abstract: Single-photon emitters are fundamental building blocks for quantum information processing, communication and sensing. However, unwanted interactions with bulk phonons in their host environment strongly limit their coherence and controllability. We report single color centers in nanodiamonds that are strongly and comprehensively decoupled from the bulk phononic environment. The color centers feature record-narrow linewidths down to 0.3 nm at room temperature and stable, bright emission, exceeding 10 Mcps in saturation. Notably, the bulk phonon sideband is almost entirely suppressed, revealing the presence of a single localized vibrational mode outside the diamond phonon band. Our observations and simulations point towards a unique mechanism for phonon decoupling in common wide-gap materials, based on a strongly radiative orbital transition coupled to a localized vibrational mode. The new color center enables qualitatively higher performance for applications in quantum networks and nanoscale sensing, and the exploration of new physical resources associated with vibrational states.

Motivation: 研究有限样本玻姆轨迹统计与玻恩规则的一致性，因为实验和模拟都使用有限样本而非量子平衡极限。

Method: 分析自旋0和自旋1/2粒子的玻姆轨迹，比较规则流（波包、谐振子低模叠加）和混沌流（3D谐振子简并叠加）的样本统计特性。

Result: 规则流中样本均值/方差与玻恩规则一致，混沌流中因初始条件敏感性和复杂流分区会出现明显偏差；自旋1/2粒子的对流流和泡利流产生不同轨迹统计。

Conclusion: 有限样本玻姆轨迹统计可能偏离玻恩规则，这为基于轨迹的不确定性解释和数值模拟提供了校准指导，但不挑战量子平衡系综下与正统量子力学的等价性。

Abstract: We analyze finite-sample statistics of Bohmian trajectories for single spinless and spin-1/2 particles. Equivariance ensures agreement with $|ψ|^2$ in the quantum equilibrium limit, yet experiments and simulations necessarily use finite ensembles. We show that in regular flows (e.g., wavepackets or low-mode superpositions of eigenstates of harmonic oscillators) sample means and/or variances over modest $N$ are consistent with Born-rule moments. In contrast, degenerate superpositions of 3D oscillators with nodal barriers and chaotic Bohmian dynamics exhibit sensitive dependence on initial conditions and complex flow partitioning, which can yield noticeable finite-sample deviations in the mean and variance. For the spin-1/2 particle, both convective and Pauli currents conserve $|ψ|^2$, but they are associated with different velocity fields and thus might yield different finite-sample trajectory statistics. These findings calibrate the interpretation of trajectory-based uncertainty and provide practical guidance for numerical Bohmian simulations of spin and transport, without challenging the equivalence to orthodox quantum mechanics in the quantum equilibrium ensemble.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反绝热驱动在复杂优化问题中（如Sherrington-Kirkpatrick模型）存在自限制问题：长演化时间导致CD强度按1/T缩放，在收敛前消失，浪费量子资源

Method: 混合自适应变分量子动力学模拟（HAVQDS），结合自适应实时演化进行电路压缩和虚时间步长抑制激发，无需额外门成本

Result: 在SK模型（6-14量子比特）上，HAVQDS比绝热或CD方法获得更高近似比，同时将CNOT门数量减少1-2个数量级，实现高保真度量子优化

Conclusion: HAVQDS方法打破了反绝热驱动的限制，为复杂量子优化问题提供了更高效的解决方案

Abstract: Counterdiabatic (CD) driving is a powerful technique for accelerating adiabatic quantum computing. However, it becomes self-limiting in complex optimizations like the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model: long evolution times $T$ needed to traverse crossings force the CD strength to scale as $1/T$, causing it to vanish before convergence and wasting the quantum resources invested in its implementation. We break this trade-off with a Hybrid adaptive variational quantum dynamics simulation (HAVQDS). HAVQDS combines adaptive real-time evolution for circuit compression with imaginary-time steps that suppress excitations at no extra gate cost. For the SK model (6--14 qubits), HAVQDS achieves higher approximation ratios than adiabatic or CD approaches, while reducing CNOT counts by 1--2 orders of magnitude, enabling high-fidelity quantum optimization.

Abstract: We investigate quantum coherence in a hybrid cavity magnomechanical system incorporating a squeezed-magnon drive. By analyzing the Gaussian quantum coherence of the cavity, magnonic, and mechanical subsystems, as well as the total system coherence, we identify the critical roles of phase control, coupling strength, drive power, and thermal noise. We show that the squeezing amplitude and phase precisely modulate the effective magnon frequency and damping, enabling phase-dependent enhancement and nonreciprocal transfer of coherence. Our systematic parameter analysis indicates that increasing driving power and photon-magnon coupling enhances quantum coherence, while thermal decoherence leads to its degradation. However, this effect is partially suppressed by the presence of magnon squeezing. The results show that squeezed magnons are a robust and tunable resource for controlling, stabilizing, and optimizing quantum coherence in cavity magnomechanical platforms, offering potential applications in hybrid magnonic systems and coherent quantum information processing.

Abstract: High-fidelity two-logical-qubit gates are essential for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computation with bosonic codes, yet experimentally reported fidelities have rarely exceeded 90\%. Here, we propose a geometric phase engineering approach for implementing controlled-phase gates for binomially encoded logical qubits. This method leverages the structural simplicity of geometric drives to reduce the numerical optimization dimensionality while fully incorporating system nonlinearities, enabling fast and high-fidelity logical operations. As an example, we experimentally demonstrate a process fidelity of 97.4$\pm$0.8\% for a controlled-Z gate between two binomial codes, surpassing all previously reported two-logical-qubit gates in bosonic codes. This work demonstrates that geometric phase engineering provides an effective and experimentally feasible route to fast, high-fidelity logical operations in bosonic quantum processors.

Motivation: 传统B92协议使用固定的明确态区分测量，缺乏对噪声和信道缺陷的适应性。phiQKD旨在通过可调谐测量设计提升协议在实际约束下的性能。

Method: 在B92协议基础上，用单参数混合POVM族替代传统明确态区分测量，通过倾斜角φ连续控制测量结果分布，并在渐进、有限密钥和可组合安全模型下评估协议。

Result: 虽然渐进密钥率相比B92改进有限，但phiQKD通过测量可调谐性提供了对噪声和信道缺陷的适应能力，在实际约束下实现了更好的性能。

Conclusion: 将量子测量作为可调谐设计参数而非固定操作，能够实现灵活的协议优化，在现实约束下提升性能。

Abstract: We introduce a tunable framework for generalized quantum state discrimination (GSD) and apply it to quantum key distribution (QKD) through a protocol we call phiQKD. Building upon the two-state B92 protocol, phiQKD replaces the traditional unambiguous state discrimination (IDP) measurement with a one-parameter family of hybrid POVMs characterized by a tilting angle $φ$. This allows for continuous control over the trade-off among correct, incorrect, and inconclusive outcomes. While the asymptotic key rate improvement over B92 is modest, phiQKD offers a practical advantage by enabling adaptability to noise and channel imperfections via measurement tunability. By evaluating the protocol under asymptotic, finite-key, and composable security models, we show that, treating quantum measurement as a tunable design parameter, rather than a fixed operation, enables flexible protocol optimization and improved performance under realistic constraints.

Abstract: The negatively charged tin-vacancy center in diamond (SnV-) is an excellent solid state qubit with optically-addressable transitions and a long electron spin coherence time at elevated temperatures. However, implementing scalable quantum nodes with high-fidelity optical readout of the electron spin state requires efficient photon emission and collection from the system. In this manuscript, we report a quantum photonic interface for SnV- centers based on one-dimensional photonic crystal cavities fabricated in diamond thin films. Furthermore, we develop a model describing the spontaneous emission dynamics of our system, allowing for rigorous determination of Purcell factors and the C/D branching ratio from cavity enhancement of the C and D transitions of the SnV- zero phonon line. We observe quality factors up to ~6000 across this sample, and measure up to a 12-fold lifetime reduction. By considering the lifetime reduction of both the C and D transitions independently, we determine the C/D branching ratio to be ηBR=0.7815, in line with previous theoretical and experimental findings. Finally from our analysis, we extract a Purcell factor of up to Fc=26.21(0.01) for a single SnV- transition.

Abstract: In earlier work, we introduced quantum blobs as minimum-uncertainty symplectic ellipsoids in phase space. These objects may be viewed as geometric monads in the Leibnizian sense, representing the elementary units of phase-space structure consistent with the uncertainty principle. We establish a one-to-one correspondence between such monads and generalized coherent states, represented by arbitrary non-degenerate Gaussian wave functions in configuration space. To each of these states, we associate a classs of Toeplitz operators that extends the standard anti-Wick quantization scheme. The mathematical and physical properties of these operators are analyzed, allowing for a generalized definition of density matrices within the phase-space formulation of quantum mechanics.

Abstract: The ability to efficiently simulate a variety of interacting quantum systems on a single device is an overarching goal for digital and analog quantum simulators. In circuit quantum electrodynamical systems, strongly nonlinear superconducting oscillators are typically realized using transmon qubits, featuring a wide range of tunable couplings that are mainly achieved via flux-dependent inductive elements. Such controllability is highly desirable both for digital quantum information processing and for analog quantum simulations of various physical phenomena, such as arbitrary spin-spin interactions. Furthermore, broad tunability facilitates the study of driven-dissipative oscillator dynamics in previously unexplored parameter regimes. In this work, we demonstrate the ability to selectively activate different dynamical regimes between two strongly nonlinear oscillators using parametric modulation. In particular, our scheme enables access to regimes that are dominated by photon-hopping, two-mode squeezing, or cross-Kerr interactions. Finally, we observe level repulsion and attraction between Kerr-nonlinear oscillators in regimes where the nonlinearities exceed the coupling strengths and decay rates of the system. Our results could be used for realizing purely analog quantum simulators to study arbitrary spin systems as well as for exploring strongly nonlinear oscillator dynamics in previously unexplored interaction regimes.

Abstract: The universal quantum computer will enable the simulation of arbitrary quantum states governed by arbitrary Hamiltonians. In this context, it is essential to equip future quantum processors with fault-tolerant logical qudits, since qudits naturally align with the simulation of multi-level physical systems. In this study, we present a general framework and working examples of fault-tolerant logical qudit encoding using spin systems, which are among the most coherent and robust finite multi-level physical platforms. The d-dimensional logical qudit encoding with distance-3 (or 5) codewords can be designed within a 12d (or 40d)-dimensional Hilbert space, and the design can be further generalized to 2t+1-distance codes and to encodings exploiting multiple physical qudits. A quantitative comparison shows that the logical qudit encoding proposed here offers an exponential resource advantage over multi-level mappings from logical qubits, and therefore we believe this strategy can pave the way for realizing logical qudit encodings in finite multi-level physical systems.

Abstract: Hybrid photonic circuits, harnessing the complementary strengths of multiple materials, represent a key resource to enable compact, scalable platforms for quantum technologies. In particular, the availability of bright sources of tunable biphoton states is eagerly awaited to meet the variety of applications currently under development. In this work we demonstrate a heterogeneously integrated device that merges biphoton generation and on-chip quantum state engineering, combining an AlGaAs photon-pair source with a CMOS-compatible silicon-on-insulator (SOI) circuit. Photon pairs are generated in the C telecom band via spontaneous parametric down-conversion and transferred to the SOI chip through a multimode evanescent coupling scheme. This design achieves a pair generation rate above 10$^{6}$ s$^{-1}$mW$^{-1}$ and a coincidence-to-accidental ratio up to 600. Crucially, the coupling design induces strong and predictable transformations of the biphoton joint spectral amplitude, enabling complex quantum state engineering entirely on-chip in a compact device compliant with electrical pumping.

Motivation: 将变分量子算法扩展到热力学极限下的激发态计算，解决传统方法在计算准粒子激发能时的局限性。

Method: 使用VQE通过单一幺正变换块对角化簇哈密顿量，然后应用PCAT进行后处理以确保簇可加性，采用迹最小化和方差基两类代价函数。

Result: 在纯TFIM中，⌈N/2⌉层即可与精确对角化结果匹配；在纵向场TFIM中，N层提供更好的精度，PCAT对收敛至关重要。

Conclusion: PCAT提供了一个簇可加框架，可将变分量子算法扩展到通过NLCE进行热力学极限下的激发态计算，该方法适用于任何量子本征态制备方法。

Abstract: We propose a quantum algorithm for computing one quasi-particle excitation energies in the thermodynamic limit by combining numerical linked-cluster expansions (NLCEs) and the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). Our approach uses VQE to block-diagonalize the cluster Hamiltonian through a single-unitary transformation. This unitary is then post-processed using the projective cluster-additive transformation (PCAT) to ensure cluster additivity, a key requirement for NLCE convergence. We benchmark our method on the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) in one and two dimensions, and with longitudinal field, computing one quasi-particle dispersions in the high-field polarized phase. We compare two cost function classes, trace minimization and variance-based, demonstrating their effectiveness with the Hamiltonian variational ansatz (HVA). For pure TFIM, $\lceil N/2 \rceil$ layers suffice: NLCE+VQE matches exact diagonalization. For TFIM with longitudinal field, where parity symmetry breaks and PCAT becomes essential, both $\lceil N/2 \rceil$ and $N$ layers converge with increasing cluster size, with $N$ layers providing improved accuracy. Our results establish PCAT as a cluster-additive framework that extends variational quantum algorithms to excited-state calculations in the thermodynamic limit via NLCE. While demonstrated with VQE, the PCAT post-processing approach, which requires only low-energy eigenspace information, applies to any quantum eigenstate preparation method.

Conclusion: 无信号投影是设备无关应用的关键预处理步骤，本文方法显著简化了计算复杂度，具有广泛应用价值。

Abstract: In this paper, we highlight how any Bell inequality for a configuration involving $n$ parties each performing one of $m$ binary-outcome measurements has a canonical form that is no-signalling-projection invariant. Specifically, the $L^2$-projection of weakly signalling data onto the no-signalling polytope leaves the violation of this canonical Bell inequality unchanged. Our methods allow us to derive a general closed formula for the projection and present a substantially more computationally simple procedure for its evaluation. We also show this can be generalised to non-standard projections of potential interest for certain applications. No-signalling projections serve as a preliminary step before undertaking any device-independent application involving Bell experiment data, such as hypothesis testing against local realism, random number generation and entanglement detection.

Conclusion: 单发射器方案需要融合技术但资源需求较少，双发射器方案避免了融合但需要更多物理qudit，为可扩展架构设计提供了不同选择

Abstract: In this work, we compare two schemes for generating arbitrary qudit graph states using spin qudits in silicon. The first scheme proposes the creation of qudit linear graph states from a single emitter - a silicon spin qudit. By employing fusion - a destructive and non-deterministic measurement technique - these linear graphs can then be combined to form more complex resource states (multi-photon entangled states), such as ring or ladder structures, which are used to carry out the computation. The second scheme employs two spin qudits. Instead of relying on fusion, the two emitters are directly coupled via CZ to generate the same resource states, thereby eliminating the need for fusion. We compare the two schemes in terms of their ability to produce equivalent resource states and discuss their respective advantages and limitations for building scalable architectures.

Abstract: Classical simulations of quantum systems are notoriously difficult computational problems, with conventional state vector and tensor network methods restricted to quantum systems that feature only a small number of qudits. The recently introduced Clifford Augmented Matrix Product State (CAMPS) method offer scalability and efficiency by combining both tensor network and stabilizer simulation techniques and leveraging their complementary advantages. This hybrid simulation method has indeed demonstrated significant improvements in simulation performance for qubit circuits. Our work generalises the CAMPS method to higher quantum degrees of freedom -- qudit simulation, resulting in a generalised CAMPS (GCAMPS). Benchmarking this extended simulator on quantum systems with three degrees of freedom, i.e. qutrits, we show that similar to the case of qubits, qutrit systems also benefit from a comparable speedup using these techniques. Indeed, we see a greater improvement with qutrit simulation compared to qubit simulation on the same $T$-doped random Clifford benchmarking circuit as a result of the increased difficulty of conventional qutrit simulation using tensor networks. This extension allows for the classical simulation of problems that were previously intractable without access to a quantum device and will open new avenues to study complex many-body physics and to develop efficient methods for quantum information processing.

Conclusion: 量子参数估计中存在新型的可达到权衡关系，这种关系允许在优化一个参数估计的同时保留对其他参数的某些信息。

Abstract: Measurement incompatibility is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics. In the context of estimating multiple parameters of a quantum system, this manifests as a fundamental trade-off between the precisions with which different parameters can be estimated. Often, a parameter can be optimally measured, but at the cost of gaining no information about incompatible parameters. Here, we report that there are systems where one parameter's information can be maximised while not completely losing information about the other parameters. In doing so, we find attainable trade-off relations for quantum parameter estimation with a structure that is different to typical Heisenberg-type trade-offs. We demonstrate our findings by implementing an optimal entangling measurement on a Quantinuum trapped-ion quantum computer.

Conclusion: ReQISC首次使连续ISA的理论优势在实际中变得可行，为量子计算性能提升提供了切实可行的路径。

Abstract: The performance of current quantum hardware is severely limited. While expanding the quantum ISA with high-fidelity, expressive basis gates is a key path forward, it imposes significant gate calibration overhead and complicates compiler optimization. As a result, even though more powerful ISAs have been designed, their use remains largely conceptual rather than practical.
  To move beyond these hurdles, we introduce the concept of "reconfigurable quantum instruction set computers" (ReQISC), which incorporates: (1) a unified microarchitecture capable of directly implementing arbitrary 2Q gates equivalently, i.e., SU(4) modulo 1Q rotations, with theoretically optimal gate durations given any 2Q coupling Hamiltonians; (2) a compilation framework tailored to ReQISC primitives for end-to-end synthesis and optimization, comprising a program-aware pass that refines high-level representations, a program-agnostic pass for aggressive circuit-level optimization, and an SU(4)-aware routing pass that minimizes hardware mapping overhead.
  We detail the hardware implementation to demonstrate the feasibility, in terms of both pulse control and calibration of this superior gate scheme on realistic hardware. By leveraging the expressivity of SU(4) and the time minimality realized by the underlying microarchitecture, the SU(4)-based ISA achieves remarkable performance, with a 4.97-fold reduction in average pulse duration to implement arbitrary 2Q gates, compared to the usual CNOT/CZ scheme on mainstream flux-tunable transmons. Supported by the end-to-end compiler, ReQISC outperforms the conventional CNOT-ISA, SOTA compiler, and pulse implementation counterparts, in significantly reducing 2Q gate counts, circuit depth, pulse duration, qubit mapping overhead, and program fidelity losses. For the first time, ReQISC makes the theoretical benefits of continuous ISAs practically feasible.

Motivation: 表面码是实现大规模容错量子计算的主要编码方案，但所需物理量子比特数量巨大。密集打包配置可以将每个逻辑量子比特所需的物理量子比特数量减少到标准配置的四分之三左右，但具体的变形过程和定量错误率分析尚未充分探索。

Conclusion: 密集打包表面码通过适当的代码变形和门调度方案，可以在减少空间开销的同时实现比标准表面码更好的容错性能，这为大规模容错量子计算提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: The surface code is one of the leading quantum error correction codes for realizing large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC). One major challenge in realizing surface-code-based FTQC is the extremely large number of qubits required. To mitigate this problem, fusing multiple codewords of the surface code into a densely packed configuration has been proposed. It is known that by using dense packing, the number of physical qubits required per logical qubit can be reduced to approximately three-fourths compared to simply placing surface-code patches side by side. Despite its potential, concrete deformation procedures and quantitative error-rate analyses have remained largely unexplored. In this work, we present a detailed code-deformation procedure that transforms multiple standard surface code patches into a densely packed, connected configuration, along with a conceptual microarchitecture to utilize this dense packing. We also propose a CNOT gate-scheduling for stabilizer measurement circuits that suppresses hook errors in the densely packed surface code. We performed circuit-level Monte Carlo noise simulation of densely packed surface codes using this gate scheduling. The numerical results demonstrate that as the code distance of the densely packed surface code increases and the physical error rate decreases, the logical error rate of the densely packed surface code becomes lower than that of the standard surface code. Furthermore, we find that only when employing hook-error-avoiding syndrome extraction can the densely packed surface code achieve a lower logical error rate than the standard surface code, while simultaneously reducing the space overhead.

Abstract: The question of which resources drive the advantages in quantum algorithms has long been a fundamental challenge. While entanglement and coherence are critical to many quantum algorithms, our results indicate that they do not fully explain the quantum advantage achieved by the Grover search algorithm. By introducing a generalized Grover search algorithm, we demonstrate that the success probability depends not only on the querying number of oracles but also on the coherence fraction, which quantifies the fidelity between an arbitrary initial quantum state and the equal superposition state. Additionally, we explore the role of the coherence fraction in the quantum minimization algorithm, which offers a framework for solving complex problems in quantum machine learning. These findings offer insights into the origins of quantum advantage and open pathways for the development of new quantum algorithms.

Abstract: Open systems feature a variety of phenomena that arise from non-Hermitian physics. Recent theoretical studies have offered much insights into these phenomena through the non-Bloch band theory, though many of the theory's key features are experimentally elusive. For instance, the correspondence between complex momenta and non-Hermitian bands, while central to non-Bloch band theory, has so far defied direct experimental observation. Here we experimentally study the non-Hermitian spectral deformation in complex-momentum space, by implementing a non-Hermitian lattice with long-range couplings in the synthetic orbital-angular-momentum (OAM) dimension of photons inside a degenerate cavity. Encoding the complex momenta in the phase and amplitude modulations of the OAM modes, and devising a complex-momentum-resolved projective detection, we reconstruct the spectral deformation in momentum space, where the eigenspectrum on the complex plane morphs through distinct geometries. This enables us to experimentally extract key information of the system under the non-Bloch band theory, including exceptional points in the complex-momentum space, the open-boundary spectra, and the generalized Brillouin zone. Our work demonstrates a versatile platform for exploring non-Hermitian physics and non-Bloch band theory, and opens the avenue for direct experimental investigation of non-Bloch features in the complex-momentum space.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement and coherence are crucial resources in quantum information theory. In some scenarios, however, it is not necessary to directly estimate entanglement or coherence measures to quantify the capabilities of a state in quantum information processing. Instead, fully entangled fraction and coherence fraction are two alternatives for entanglement and coherence in specific quantum tasks. Here, we establish a link between the coherence fraction and the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm, which has several potential applications including cryptography and database search. We show that the success probability of the generalized Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm depends only on the coherence fraction of the initial state rather than its entanglement or coherence. Moreover, we discuss the coherence fraction dynamics and establish a relation between the operator's coherence fraction and the algorithm's success probability. Our findings highlight how quantum coherence fraction influences the efficiency of quantum algorithms.

Method: 提出了三种不同的量子随机游走搜索算法变体，并推导了它们成功概率的精确解析表达式。分析了初始态属性（相干分数、纠缠和相干性）对算法性能的影响。

Result: 发现相干分数的增加会提高第一个算法的成功概率，但纠缠和相干性的增加会降低后两个算法的成功概率。这些算法实现了类似Grover的加速效果。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了利用量子属性获得优势的基本原理，为算法设计提供了指导，并展示了量子增强机器学习的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Quantum algorithms have demonstrated provable speedups over classical counterparts, yet establishing a comprehensive theoretical framework to understand the quantum advantage remains a core challenge. In this work, we decode the quantum search advantage by investigating the critical role of quantum state properties in random-walk-based algorithms. We propose three distinct variants of quantum random-walk search algorithms and derive exact analytical expressions for their success probabilities. These probabilities are fundamentally determined by specific initial state properties: the coherence fraction governs the first algorithm's performance, while entanglement and coherence dominate the outcomes of the second and third algorithms, respectively. We show that increased coherence fraction enhances success probability, but greater entanglement and coherence reduce it in the latter two cases. These findings reveal fundamental insights into harnessing quantum properties for advantage and guide algorithm design. Our searches achieve Grover-like speedups and show significant potential for quantum-enhanced machine learning.

Motivation: 寻找量子最优控制和动力学中的解析解，回答三个基本问题：由单项式生成的有限维李代数、包含自由哈密顿量的有限维李代数，以及可在Weyl代数中忠实实现的非阿贝尔有限维李代数。

Abstract: We study, classify, and explore the mathematical properties of finite-dimensional Lie algebras occurring in the quantum dynamics of single-mode and self-interacting bosonic systems. These Lie algebras are contained in the real skew-hermitian Weyl algebra $\hat{A}_1$, defined as the real subalgebra of the Weyl algebra $A_1$ consisting of all skew-hermitian polynomials. A central aspect of our analysis is the choice of basis for $\hat{A}_1$, which is composed of skew-symmetric combinations of two elements of the Weyl algebra called monomials, namely strings of creation and annihilation operators combined with their hermitian conjugate. Motivated by the quest for analytical solutions in quantum optimal control and dynamics, we aim at answering the following three fundamental questions: (i) What are the finite-dimensional Lie subalgebras in $\hat{A}_1$ generated by monomials alone? (ii)~What are the finite-dimensional Lie subalgebras in $\hat{A}_1$ that contain the free Hamiltonian? (iii) What are the non-abelian and finite-dimensional Lie subalgebras that can be faithfully realized in $\hat{A}_1$? We answer the first question by providing all possible realizations of all finite-dimensional non-abelian Lie algebras that are generated by monomials alone. We answer the second question by proving that any non-abelian and finite-dimensional subalgebra of $\hat{A}_1$ that contains a free Hamiltonian term must be a subalgebra of the Schrödinger algebra. We partially answer the third question by classifying all nilpotent and non-solvable Lie algebras that can be realized in $\hat{A}_1$, and comment on the remaining cases. Finally, we also discuss the implications of our results for quantum control theory. Our work constitutes an important stepping stone to understanding quantum dynamics of bosonic systems in full generality.

Abstract: Noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers hold the promise of tackling complex and otherwise intractable computational challenges through the massive parallelism offered by qubits. Central to realizing the potential of quantum computing are perfect entangling (PE) two-qubit gates, which serve as a critical building block for universal quantum computation. In the context of quantum optimal control, shaping electromagnetic pulses to drive quantum gates is crucial for pushing gate performance toward theoretical limits. In this work, we leverage reinforcement learning (RL) techniques to discover near-optimal pulse shapes that yield PE gates. A collection of RL agents is trained within robust simulation environments, enabling the identification of effective control strategies even under noisy conditions. Selected agents are then validated on higher-fidelity simulations, illustrating how RL-based methods can reduce calibration overhead when compared to quantum optimal control techniques. Furthermore, the RL approach is hardware agnostic with the potential for broad applicability across various quantum computing platforms.

Motivation: 当前量子处理器存在固有噪声，量子误差缓解技术虽然能提高计算保真度，但会产生大量测量开销，特别是在处理参数化量子电路族时。

Method: 利用经典学习代理在经典侧执行零噪声外推，仅需恒定测量开销即可处理整个量子电路族，而传统ZNE的测量成本随电路数量线性增长。

Conclusion: S-ZNE为可扩展误差缓解开辟了有前景的路径，该方法可有效扩展到其他量子误差缓解协议。

Abstract: The pursuit of practical quantum utility on near-term quantum processors is critically challenged by their inherent noise. Quantum error mitigation (QEM) techniques are leading solutions to improve computation fidelity with relatively low qubit-overhead, while full-scale quantum error correction remains a distant goal. However, QEM techniques incur substantial measurement overheads, especially when applied to families of quantum circuits parameterized by classical inputs. Focusing on zero-noise extrapolation (ZNE), a widely adopted QEM technique, here we devise the surrogate-enabled ZNE (S-ZNE), which leverages classical learning surrogates to perform ZNE entirely on the classical side. Unlike conventional ZNE, whose measurement cost scales linearly with the number of circuits, S-ZNE requires only constant measurement overhead for an entire family of quantum circuits, offering superior scalability. Theoretical analysis indicates that S-ZNE achieves accuracy comparable to conventional ZNE in many practical scenarios, and numerical experiments on up to 100-qubit ground-state energy and quantum metrology tasks confirm its effectiveness. Our approach provides a template that can be effectively extended to other quantum error mitigation protocols, opening a promising path toward scalable error mitigation.

Abstract: The geometric phase stands as a foundational concept in quantum physics, revealing deep connections between geometric structures and quantum dynamical evolution. Unlike dynamical phases, geometric phases exhibit intrinsic resilience to certain types of perturbation, making them particularly valuable for quantum information processing, where maintaining coherent quantum operations is essential. This article provides a review of geometric phases in the context of universal quantum gate construction, i.e., the geometric quantum computation (GQC), with special attention to recent progress in nonadiabatic implementations that enhance gate fidelity and/or operational robustness. We first review a unified theoretical framework that can encompass all existing nonadiabatic GQC approaches, then systematically examine the design principles of nonadiabatic geometric gates with a particular focus on how optimal control techniques can be leveraged to improve the accuracy and noise resistance. In addition, we conducted detailed numerical comparisons of various nonadiabatic GQC protocols, offering a quantitative assessment of their respective performance characteristics and practical limitations. Through this focused investigation, our aim is to provide researchers with both fundamental insights and practical guidance for advancing geometric approaches in quantum computing.

Abstract: Quantum batteries (QBs), acting as energy storage devices, have potential applications in future quantum science and technology. However, the QBs inevitably losses energy due to their interaction with environment. How to enhance the performance of the QBs in the open-system case remains an important challenge. Here we propose a scheme to realize the driven-dissipative QBs in atom-waveguide-QED systems and demonstrate significant improvements in both the stored energy and extractable work (ergotropy) of the QBs via feedback control. For a single-atom QB, we show that combining the measurement and coherent feedback controls enables nearly perfect stable charging under the weak coherent driving. For the QB array, the measurement-based feedback allows us to control different dynamical phases in the thermodynamic limit: (i) a continuous boundary time-crystal phase, where persistent periodic energy charge-discharge oscillations emerge despite the presence of the dissipation into the waveguide, and (ii) two stationary phases -- one reaches full charge while the other maintains only small energy storage. This work broadens the scope of driven-dissipative QBs and provides practical strategies for enhancing their performance.

Abstract: Here, we develop the exact dynamics of the central spin model, modeling a finite-bath open quantum system. Particularly, two different types of interactions are investigated between the system and the bath: Heisenberg interaction with constant interaction strength, and a stochastic time-dependent interaction. In the former case, a new quantum channel is characterized, while the latter elucidates the microscopic understanding of a very well-known non-Markovian quantum channel. Exact master equations are provided in both scenarios. This is achieved by developing a new technique for obtaining a master equation from the map, making use of the concept of a minimal dissipator. This paves the way for a foundational understanding of finite-bath open quantum systems and a number of novel applications in the vast domain of quantum physics, one of which, implemented here, is in quantum thermodynamics.

Conclusion: 证明了相对论时间膨胀的互补效应：未发射光子的激发态原子会经历加速，这为研究量子系统与相对论效应的相互作用提供了新视角。

Abstract: Relativistic time dilation implies that an accelerating excited atom would have its lifetime prolonged in the lab frame. In this paper, we demonstrate a complementary effect: Longer-lived excited atoms turn out to have been accelerated. We propose the following experiment. An excited atom is prepared in a superposition of momenta. Due to relativistic time dilation, in the lab frame, the decay rate of components with higher momentum is diminished. As time passes without the atom emitting a photon, higher-momentum components become more probable. This results in a time-dependent shift of the expectation value of momentum. Taking into account first-order relativistic corrections, we calculate the force and acceleration undergone by the atom due to the fact that it did not emit a photon.

Abstract: We investigate optimal metrological protocols for phase estimation in the presence of correlated dephasing noise, including spin-squeezed states sensing strategies as well as parallel and adaptive protocols optimized using tensor-network based numerical methods. The results are benchmarked against fundamental bounds obtained either via a latest quantum comb extension method or an optimized classical simulation method. We find that the spin-squeezed offer practically optimal performance in the regime where phase fluctuations are positively correlated, but can be outperformed by tensor-network optimized strategies for negatively correlated fluctuations.

Abstract: Matrix-product state (MPS) skeletons are connected networks of Hamiltonians with exact MPS ground states that underlie a phase diagram. Such skeletons have previously been found in classes of free-fermion models. For the translation-invariant BDI and AIII free-fermion classes, it has been shown that the underlying skeleton is dense, giving an analytic approach to MPS approximation of ground states anywhere in the class. In this paper, we partially expose the skeleton in certain interacting spin chains: the $N$-state Onsager-integrable chiral clock families. We construct MPS that form a dense MPS skeleton in the gapped regions surrounding a sequence of fixed-point Hamiltonians (the generators of the Onsager algebra). Outside these gapped regions, these MPS remain eigenstates, but no longer give the many-body ground state. Rather, they are ground states in particular sectors of the spectrum. Our methods also allow us to find further MPS eigenstates; these correspond to low-lying excited states within the aforementioned gapped regions. This set of MPS excited states goes beyond the previous analysis of ground states on the $N=2$ free-fermion MPS skeleton. As an application of our results, we find a closed form for the disorder parameter in a family of interacting models. Finally, we remark that many of our results use only the Onsager algebra and are not specific to the chiral clock model representation.

Abstract: In this work, we introduce the Quantum-Classical Hybrid Physics-Informed Neural Network with Multiplicative and Additive Couplings (QPINN-MAC): a novel hybrid architecture that integrates the framework of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with that of Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs). Specifically, we prove that through strategic couplings between classical and quantum components, the QPINN-MAC retains the universal approximation property, ensuring its theoretical capacity to represent complex solutions of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Simultaneously, we demonstrate that the hybrid QPINN-MAC architecture actively mitigates the barren plateau problem, regions in parameter space where cost-function gradients decay exponentially with circuit depth, a fundamental obstacle in QNNs that hinders optimization during training. Furthermore, we prove that these couplings prevent gradient collapse, ensuring trainability even in high-dimensional regimes. Thus, our results establish a new pathway for constructing quantum-classical hybrid models with theoretical convergence guarantees, which are essential for the practical application of QPINNs.

Abstract: A spin precessing in a magnetic field is often used as a quantum clock, for example in tunneling-time measurements. We show that such a clock can exist in a coherent superposition of opposite temporal orientations, treating the arrow of time as a quantum two-level system. A Mach-Zehnder interferometer with equal and opposite magnetic fields provides a simple implementation, enabling interference between forward and backward evolution and Bell-type tests of temporal coherence. Extending the framework to relativistic dynamics reveals that the Dirac Hamiltonian describes an intrinsic coupling between a spin qubit and a time qubit, with matter and antimatter corresponding to opposite poles on the temporal Bloch sphere.

Abstract: We show that harnessing daemonic advantage is possible while charging a quantum battery by first time-evolving the battery collectively with an auxiliary charger, followed by an energy extraction via tracing out the charger. We define the difference between the minimum daemonic ergotropy and the maximum ergotropy of the battery as the daemonic gap at the time where the ergotropy of the battery is maximum. Considering a harmonic mode as the battery and a qubit as the auxiliary charger interacting via Jaynes-Cummings interaction, we show that the daemonic gap can be closed for specific initial passive states of the battery, including the ground state, truncated mixtures of low-lying states, and canonical thermal states. We further define the daemonic band as the difference between the maximum and the minimum daemonic ergotropy, and show that starting from the ground state of the single-mode battery, the daemonic band collapses. We also show that achieving a complete charging, along with accessing the full daemonic band, is possible for the single-mode battery using all of the other initial states by repeating the charging cycle and maximizing ergotropy in every round. We extend the battery-charger design to a multi-mode resonator battery and a qudit charger, and demonstrate, for a double-mode battery and a qutrit charger, that repeating the charging cycle is vital for simultaneously charging individual modes of the collective battery.

In this work, we show that a driven quantum walk in an array of nonlinear waveguides does not propagate ballistically, but instead exhibits two distinct transport regimes: superballistic and superdiffusive. Moreover, we study the effects of off-diagonal and diagonal disorder. In addition to the observation of Anderson localization, both types of disorder lead to the disappearance of the superballistic regime.

Motivation: 随着实验向容错量子计算发展，量子计算验证变得至关重要。但目前缺乏对魔术态注入模型（多种容错量子计算架构的基础）所生成态的高效认证协议。

Method: 开发了一种高效协议，仅需单量子比特泡利测量和高效经典后处理，在独立和非独立设置下都具有高效样本复杂度。该协议适用于通过任意Clifford电路作用于单量子比特态（可能包含魔术态）乘积得到的量子态。

Result: 该协议填补了基于泡利的稳定子态或（超）图态认证方案与需要非泡利测量或经典难处理目标态信息的一般协议之间的关键空白。

Conclusion: 这项工作为魔术态注入模型提供了首个高效的、仅需泡利测量的认证协议，在最小实验假设下实现了通用量子计算的实用验证。

Abstract: Verification of quantum computations is crucial as experiments advance toward fault-tolerant quantum computing. Yet, no efficient protocol exists for certifying states generated in the Magic-State Injection model -- the foundation of several fault-tolerant quantum computing architectures. Here, we introduce an efficient protocol for certifying Clifford-enhanced Product States, a large class of quantum states obtained by applying an arbitrary Clifford circuit to a product of single-qubit, possibly magic, states. Our protocol only requires single-qubit Pauli measurements together with efficient classical post-processing, and has efficient sample complexity in both the independent (i.i.d.) and adversarial (non-i.i.d.) settings. This fills a key gap between Pauli-based certification schemes for stabilizer or (hyper)graph states and general protocols demanding non-Pauli measurements or classically intractable information about the target state. Our work provides the first efficient, Pauli-only certification protocol for the Magic-State Injection model, leading to practical verification of universal quantum computation under minimal experimental assumptions.

*Chiara Marletto,Jonathan Oppenheim,Vlatko Vedral,Elizabeth Wilson*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 该论文反驳了Aziz和Howl关于经典引力能产生纠缠的主张，证明他们的模型实际上不会产生纠缠，即使能产生也是通过量子化物质相互作用而非引力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对Nature期刊上Aziz和Howl声称经典引力能产生纠缠的论断进行反驳，澄清引力量子特性的关键证据。

Method: 通过分析Aziz和Howl提出的模型，证明该模型实际上不会产生量子纠缠，并区分引力与量子化物质相互作用的作用机制。

Result: 证明Aziz和Howl的模型不能产生纠缠，即使能产生也是通过量子化物质相互作用，而非经典引力本身。

Conclusion: 引力介导的纠缠仍然是引力量子特性的明确证据，经典引力无法产生量子纠缠。

Abstract: In Nature, 646, 813 (2025), Aziz and Howl claim that classical (unquantised) gravity produces entanglement. We show that their model does not produce entanglement. Even if the model produced entanglement, it would be mediated by the quantised matter interaction, and not gravity. Hence entanglement mediated by gravity remains an unambiguous witness of gravity's quantum features.

### [91] [Decoherence from universal tomographic measurements](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07369)
*Dorje C. Brody,Rishindra Melanathuru*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 本文研究了量子系统状态（而非特定可观测量）被环境监测时产生的退相干现象，通过两种等价方法分析：基于POVM的通用层析测量和Lindblad方程的连续时间展开。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索环境对量子系统状态的通用监测如何导致退相干，以及这种退相干如何促使准概率分布变得非负，从而模拟经典性的出现。

Method: 使用两种等价方法：重复应用基于POVM的通用层析测量，以及从Lindblad方程导出的连续时间展开。通过研究Stratonovich-Weyl准概率分布在系统状态空间上的演化来分析退相干效应。

Result: 退相干使任意给定的准概率分布变得明显非负，模拟了经典性的出现。退相干时间尺度（所有初始状态的准概率分布变为非负所需的最短时间）随希尔伯特空间维度的增加而减小，因此更大的量子系统退相干更快。

Conclusion: 环境对量子系统状态的通用监测会导致退相干，使准概率分布非负化，这一过程模拟了量子到经典的转变，且系统越大退相干越快。

Abstract: The decoherence phenomenon arising from an environmental monitoring of the state of a quantum system, as opposed to monitoring of a preferred observable, is worked out in detail using two equivalent formulations, namely, repeated applications of universal tomographic measurements using positive operator-valued measures, and its continuous time unravelling from the Lindblad equation. The effect of decoherence is analysed by studying the evolution of Stratonovich-Weyl quasiprobability distributions on the state-space of the system. It is shown that decoherence makes an arbitrary-given quasiprobability distribution manifestly positive, thus modelling the emergence of classicality in some sense. The decoherence timescale, the minimum time that quasiprobability distributions of every initial state of the system become nonnegative, is shown to decrease in Hilbert-space dimension, and hence larger quantum systems decohere faster.

Result: 生成模型在单次前向传递中产生自适应QAOA类电路和变分参数，平均近似比超过0.95，与经典优化的ADAPT-QAOA结果相当，且在不同电路深度下保持一致的参数分布。

Conclusion: QAOA-GPT能有效推广到高阶代价哈密顿量和复杂能量景观，为NISQ时代的自主变分电路设计和量子算法发现提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: The recently proposed QAOA-GPT framework demonstrated that generative pre-trained transformers can learn mappings between problem graphs and optimized quantum circuits for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). In this work, we extend QAOA-GPT to Higher-Order Unconstrained Binary Optimization (HUBO) problems, focusing on spin-glass Hamiltonians that include cubic interaction terms. Using FEATHER graph embeddings to encode topological information, we train the model on graph-circuit pairs generated via ADAPT-QAOA and evaluate its performance on 8- and 16-qubit instances embedded on heavy-hex lattices. The generative model produces adaptive QAOA-like circuits and corresponding variational parameters in a single forward pass, bypassing the iterative classical optimization loop. The generated circuits achieve average approximation ratios exceeding 0.95, closely matching classically optimized ADAPT-QAOA results, while maintaining consistent parameter distributions across circuit depths. These results demonstrate that QAOA-GPT generalizes effectively to higher-order cost Hamiltonians and complex energy landscapes, establishing generative modeling as a scalable pathway toward autonomous variational circuit design and quantum algorithm discovery in the NISQ era.

Abstract: With steady progress in the development of quantum networks, the question on how to best provide end-to-end characterization of such networks (Quantum Network Tomography) is quickly becoming more pressing. Initial results demonstrated how we can utilize multipartite entanglement distribution to determine error probabilities of single-Pauli channels and depolarizing channels. In this work, we show how the analysis of quantum capacity regions can be used as a powerful new tool in quantum network tomography. As a first application of the proposed method, we demonstrate how we can characterize the loss on quantum channels in the network directly from quantum capacity region diagrams, even in the presence of bit-flip errors. Our results indicate that quantum capacity regions are not only valuable for network design, resource allocation, and protocol benchmarking, but also show promise for applications in quantum network tomography, particularly in loss tomography.
