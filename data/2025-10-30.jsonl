Simulating such two-local\nHamiltonian dynamics remains a major challenge, as methods with controllable\naccuracy require circuit depths that increase at least linearly with system\nsize, exceeding the capabilities of current quantum devices. The eigenstate\nthermalization hypothesis predicts that these systems should thermalize, a\nbehavior confirmed in small-scale classical simulations. In this work, we\ninvestigate flavor thermalization in much larger systems using random quantum\ncircuits as an empirical tool to emulate the non-local dynamics, and\ndemonstrate that the thermal behavior can be reproduced using a depth\nindependent of the system size. By simulating dynamics of over one hundred\nqubits, we find that the thermalization time grows approximately as the square\nroot of the system size, consistent with predictions from semi-classical\nmethods.

This work explores the\nsimulation of quantum systems and sets itself apart from approaches centered on\nclassical data processing, by focusing on the critical role of quantum data in\nVariational Quantum Algorithms (VQA) and Quantum Machine Learning (QML). We\nsystematically delineate the foundational principles of variational quantum\ncomputing, establish their motivational and challenges context within the noisy\nintermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, and critically examine their application\nacross a range of prototypical quantum simulation problems. Operating within a\nhybrid quantum-classical framework, these algorithms represent a promising yet\nproblem-dependent pathway whose practicality remains contingent on trainability\nand scalability under noise and barren-plateau constraints.This review serves\nto complement and extend existing literature by synthesizing the most recent\nadvancements in the field and providing a focused perspective on the persistent\nchallenges and emerging opportunities that define the current landscape of\nvariational quantum computing for quantum simulation."}

Specifically, let $\\mathcal{H}\\cong\n\\mathbb{C}^d$ be a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space with an orthonormal basis\n$\\{|1\\rangle,\\ldots,|d\\rangle\\}$ and $U$ be an unknown unitary on\n$\\mathcal{H}$. Our protocol estimates $U|d\\rangle$ to within trace distance\nerror $\\varepsilon$ using $O(\\min\\{d^{3/2}/\\varepsilon,d/\\varepsilon^2\\})$\nforward queries to $U$. This complements the previous result\n$O(d\\log(d)/\\varepsilon)$ by van Apeldoorn, Cornelissen, Gily\\'en, and\nNannicini (SODA 2023), which requires both forward and inverse queries.\nMoreover, our result implies a query upper bound\n$O(\\min\\{d^{3/2}/\\varepsilon,1/\\varepsilon^2\\})$ for inverse-free amplitude\nestimation, improving the previous best upper bound\n$O(\\min\\{d^{2}/\\varepsilon,1/\\varepsilon^2\\})$ based on optimal unitary\nestimation by Haah, Kothari, O'Donnell, and Tang (FOCS 2023), and disproving a\nconjecture posed in Tang and Wright (2025)."}

The possibility of an effectively\nattractive character of the minority components is established by constructing\na generalized reduction scheme for an imbalanced N-component setup with\narbitrary interaction signs. These components may suffer intra- and\ninter-component modulation instability, which along with the presence of an\nattractive potential well induces the dynamical formation of highly\nreproducible vector rogue waves. Exploiting different Rb hyperfine states, it\nis possible to flexibly tune the effective interactions stimulating the\nrealization of a plethora of vector rogue waves, including single and double\nPeregrine-like wave peaks. The experimental findings are in quantitative\nagreement with suitable three-dimensional mean-field simulations, while\nquasi-one-dimensional analysis of the non-polynomial Schr\\\"odinger model\nprovides additional insights into the rogue wave characteristics."}

It\nis therefore crucial to efficiently generate free-electron wave functions that\nare suitable for these applications. In this study, we theoretically\ninvestigate an efficient free-space optical modulation of free electrons with\ntwo counter-propagating Gaussian beams. We find that the Gaussian beams' Gouy\nphase not only plays a crucial role in the interaction, but also enables\nstraight-forward generation of valuable free-electron states, including\ncomb-shape spectra with similar amplitudes, and states with high degree of\ncoherence. We also discuss the feasibility of demonstrating these Gouy\nphase-related effects with chirped femto-second laser pulses. Our study\nestablishes a theoretical foundation and physical intuition about the role of\nthe Gouy phase. It can provide guidance to efficiently shape the free-electron\nwave function for a wide range of quantum applications."}

But the major components themselves hardly change. Most modern\ninterferometers rely on the same conventional set of components to separate the\nelectromagnetic field into multiple beams, such as plate optics and\nbeam-splitters. This naturally limits the design scope and thus the potential\napplicability and performance. However, recent investigations suggest that\nincorporating novel, higher-dimensional linear-optical splitters in\ninterferometer design can lead to several improvements. In this work, we review\nthe underlying theory of these novel optical scatterers and some demonstrated\nconfigurations with enhanced resolution. The basic principles of optical\ninterference and optical phase sensing are discussed in tandem. Emphasis is\nplaced on both familiar and unfamiliar scatterers, such as the\nmaximally-symmetric Grover multiport, whose actions are left unchanged by\ncertain gauge transformations. These higher-dimensional, gauge-invariant\nmultiports embody a new class of building blocks which can tailor optical\ninterference for metrology in unconventional ways."}

In 1951, Wigner introduced the concept of a statistical\ndescription of energy levels of heavy atoms, which led to the rise of Random\nMatrix Theory (RMT) in physics. The theory successfully captured spectral\nproperties across a wide range of atomic systems, circumventing the\ncomplexities of quantum many-body interactions. Rooted in the fundamental\nprinciples of stochasticity and symmetry, RMT has since found applications and\nrevealed universal laws in diverse physical contexts, from quantum field theory\nto disordered systems and wireless communications. A particularly compelling\napplication arises in describing the mathematical structure of the many-body\nwavefunction of non-interacting Fermi gases, which underpins a complex spatial\norganization driven by Pauli's exclusion principle. However, experimental\nvalidation of the counting statistics predicted in such systems has remained\nelusive. Here, we probe at the single-atom level ultracold atomic Fermi gases\nmade of two interacting spin states, obtaining direct access to their counting\nstatistics in situ. Our measurements show that, while the system is strongly\nattractive, each spin-component is extremely well described by RMT predictions\nbased on Fredholm determinants. Our results constitutes the first experimental\nvalidation of the Fermi-sphere point process through the lens of RMT, and\nestablishes its relevance for strongly-interacting systems."}
