Among the various reinforcement learning methodologies, gradient-based approaches, particularly policy gradient methods, are considered to have many benefits. Moreover, in the quantum regime, they also have a profit in that they can be readily implemented through parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). From the perspective of learning, two indicators can be regarded as most crucial: expressivity and, for gradient-based methods, trainability. While a number of attempts have been made to quantify the expressivity and trainability of PQCs, clear efforts in the context of reinforcement learning have so far been lacking. Therefore, in this study, we newly define the notion of expressivity suited to reinforcement learning and demonstrate that the mutual information between action distribution and reward-signal distribution can, in certain respects, indicate information about both expressivity and trainability. Such research is valuable in that it provides an easy criterion for choosing among various PQCs employed in reinforcement learning, and further, enables the indirect estimation of learning progress even in black-box settings where the agent's achievement aligned with the episodes cannot be explicitly evaluated."}

The discussion that followed has emphasized a basic point: writing down coordinate maps is not the same thing as providing a physical theory. In particular, quantum superposition is not operationally defined by drawing multiple paths on paper: it is defined by what happens when alternatives recombine in an interference loop [2, 3]. In parallel, careful 1+1 analyses have clarified how sign conventions and time-orientation choices enter the superluminal formulas [4]. Finally, tachyonic QFT proposals suggest a possible mathematical bridge via an enlarged (twin) Hilbert space [5], although this proposal remains contested (e.g., on commutator covariance and microcausality grounds) [6]. The aim of this short note is organizational. We keep three layers separate: (K) kinematics (which maps exist and what they preserve), (O) operational content (what an experiment must actually reproduce, especially closed-loop interference), and (D/B) dynamics and bridges (how amplitudes and probabilities are generated, and how subluminal and superluminal sectors might be linked). The goal is not relativity derives quantum theory, but a clear checklist of what must be added for that ambition to become a well-posed programme."}

In this work, we present an automated compilation framework for resource-aware quantum data loading tailored to a given input vector and target error tolerance. By explicitly exploiting the trade-off between exact and approximate state preparation, our approach systematically partitions the total error budget between precision and approximation errors, thereby minimizing quantum resource costs. The framework supports a comprehensive suite of state-of-the-art methods, including multiplexer-based loaders, quantum read-only memory (QROM) constructions, sparse encodings, matrix product states (MPS), Fourier series loaders (FSL), and Walsh transform-based diagonal operators. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework across several applications, where it consistently uncovers non-obvious, resource-efficient strategies enabled by controlled approximation. In particular, we analyze a computational fluid dynamics workflow where the automated selection of MPS state preparation and Walsh transform-based encoding, combined with a novel Walsh-based measurement technique, leads to resource reductions of over four orders of magnitude compared to previous approaches. We also introduce two independent advances developed through the framework: a more efficient circuit for d-diagonal matrices, and an optimized block encoding for kinetic energy operators. Our results underscore the indispensable role of automated, approximation-aware compilation in making large-scale quantum algorithms feasible on resource-constrained hardware."}

Tracing out the electronic and photonic environments leads to a Liouvillian for the upper (UP) and lower (LP) polaritonic branches, incorporating leakage through the imaginary part of the self-energy, internal UP-LP scattering rates, and dephasing. Time evolution equations for polariton populations, interbranch coherence, and driven amplitudes in closed form also provide analytic expressions for their steady-state values, the quench rate of UP-LP oscillations and polaritonic lineshapes, valid in the limit of low polaritonic density, but covering light-matter ultrastrong coupling. The theory establishes a self-consistent description of dissipative polariton dynamics in plasmonic and nanophotonic cavities, directly applicable to response spectra, time-domain measurements, and dissipation engineering."}

When quenching detuning gradient below its initial value, the vortex lattices exhibit interesting periodic rotation motion, and their dynamical stability can persist for up to 1000ms. In particular, depending on the detuning gradient, the twin vortices exhibit either a scissors-like rotational oscillation or a clockwise periodic rotation, reflecting the response to the magnetic field gradient experienced by the condensates. We fit the numerical results to quantitatively analyze the relation between rotation dynamics and magnetic field gradients. When quenching the detuning gradient beyond its initial value, additional vortices appear. Our findings may motivate further experimental studies of vortex dynamics in synthetic magnetic fields and offer insights for engineering a BEC-based magnetic field gradiometer."}

While standard formulas describe the interference of circular Gaussian beams, many real systems use beams with elliptical cross sections, where differing waists and radii of curvature can reduce fringe visibility. This paper derives an analytic expression for the maximum contrast achievable between two aligned elliptical Gaussian beams, written entirely in terms of their geometric and power parameters. We then test the formula using a free-space Michelson interferometer in which all beam parameters are independently measured through beam profiling and nonlinear fitting. In our experiment, the predicted maximum contrast was 0.968 while the experimentally optimized value was 0.950. The small discrepancy is consistent with expected imperfections such as beam rotation, mode mismatch, and non-Gaussian aberrations. This work provides a practical tool for modeling and optimizing elliptical-beam interferometers."}

Employing a Fermi-Hubbard model alongside the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method, we examine the combined effects of RSOC and DSOC on these exotic superfluid phases, taking into account attractive fermionic interactions. Our principal finding reveals that while RSOC primarily stabilizes conventional zero-momentum pairing, DSOC performs a distinct and crucial role in selectively stabilizing the intraband FFLO phase. This stabilization is achieved by enhancing spin polarization within a single helicity band and suppressing interband coherence, thereby facilitating the formation of finite-momentum FFLO pairs within the same band and resulting in the emergence of a topologically nontrivial superfluid. This targeted control of intraband FFLO pairing paves the way for new strategies in the manipulation of superfluid phases in spin-orbit coupled systems and offers essential insights for experimental realizations in ultracold atomic gases, with implications for topological quantum computing and Majorana fermions."}

Dynamic radiative thermal emitters that can switch between passive cooling and heating modes offer a promising solution, but most existing devices exhibit broadband optical responses, resulting in unwanted parasitic heat exchange and limited performance. Here, we introduce an elegant strategy that uses a dielectric cap to transform broadband metal-insulator transition (MIT) materials into spectrally selective dynamic emitters. This design creates a highly tunable Fabry-Perot cavity, enabling a tailored thermal emission spectrum by engineering the reflected-wave phase profile. Our Fresnel-formalism-based phasor diagram analysis reveals two key routes for realizing high spectral selectivity: a high-index dielectric cap and a low-loss metallic MIT state, which are further validated by Bayesian optimization. Following this principle, we demonstrated a wide-angle spectrally-selective thermoregulator operating in the atmospheric transparency window (8-13 um), where the thermal emittance can be electrically tuned from about 0.2 to 0.9 through reversible copper electrodeposition on a germanium cavity. Furthermore, this strategy can be extended to multispectral electrochromic windows, enabling switching between solar heating and spectrally-selective radiative cooling. Our work establishes a versatile and generalizable paradigm for spectral engineering of dynamic thermal emitters, opening opportunities in energy-efficient buildings, wearable thermal comfort, spacecraft thermoregulation, and multispectral camouflage."}

Surprisingly, we show that the tendency toward a collective spin description need not imply collective spin phenomena; rather, it can be exploited to generate new forms of strongly correlated quantum matter. The key idea is to use uniform cavity-mediated interactions to energetically project the system into the total-spin singlet sector ($S=0$) - a highly entangled subspace where the physics is governed entirely by cavity fluctuations. Focusing on Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a single-mode cavity, we show that global cavity fluctuations can effectively squeeze classical antiferromagnets into quantum spin liquids, characterized by non-local entanglement, fractionalized excitations, and emergent gauge fields. This work suggests that cavity QED can be a surprising resource for inducing strongly correlated phenomena, which could be explored in the new generation of hybrid tweezer-cavity platforms."}

We establish a framework for performing such simulations on a quantum computer and apply it to a heavy quark moving across a modest-sized 1+1D SU(2) lattice of light quarks. Conceptual advances with regard to simulations of non-Abelian versus Abelian theories are developed, allowing for the evolution of the energy in light quarks, of their local non-Abelian charge densities, and of their multi-partite entanglement to be computed. The non-trivial action of non-Abelian charge operators on arbitrary states suggests mapping the heavy quarks to qubits alongside the light quarks, and limits the heavy-quark motion to discrete steps among spatial lattice sites. Further, the color entanglement among the heavy quarks and light quarks is implemented using hadronic operators, and Domain Decomposition is shown to be effective in quantum state preparation. Scalable quantum circuits that account for the heterogeneity of non-Abelian charge sectors across the lattice are used to prepare the interacting ground-state wavefunction in the presence of heavy quarks. The discrete motion of heavy quarks between adjacent spatial sites is implemented using fermionic SWAP operations. Quantum simulations of the dynamics of a system on $L=3$ spatial sites are performed using IBM's ${\\tt ibm\\_pittsburgh}$ quantum computer using 18 qubits, for which the circuits for state preparation, motion, and one second-order Trotter step of time evolution have a two-qubit depth of 398.

Optical neural networks, capitalizing on the inherent parallelism and speed of light propagation, present a compelling solution. Nevertheless, physically realizing convolutional neural network (CNN) components all-optically remains a significant challenge. To this end, we propose a metasurface-based all-optical diffractive convolutional neural network (MAODCNN) for computer vision tasks. This architecture synergistically integrates metasurface-based optical convolutional layers, which perform parallel convolution on the optical field, with cascaded diffractive neural networks acting as all-optical decoders. This co-design facilitates layer-wise feature extraction and optimization directly within the optical domain. Numerical simulations confirm that the fusion of convolutional and diffractive layers markedly enhances classification accuracy, a performance that scales with the number of diffractive layers. The MAODCNN framework establishes a viable foundation for practical all-optical CNNs, paving the way for high-efficiency, low-power optical computing in advanced pattern recognition."}

Of particular interest for near-term demonstrations of quantum computational advantage are analog quantum simulations, which employ analog controls instead of digitized gates. Most analog quantum simulations to date, however, have been performed using qubit-based processors, despite the fact that many physical systems are more naturally represented in terms of qudits (i.e., $d$-level systems). Motivated by this, we present an experimental realization of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) model using an analog simulator based on a single superconducting transmon qudit with up to $d = 9$ levels. This is accomplished by moving to a rotated frame in which evolution under any time-dependent local field and one-axis twisting can be realized by the application of multiple simultaneous drives. Combining this analog drive scheme with universal control and single-shot readout of the qudit state, we provide a detailed study of five finite-size precursors of quantum criticality in the LMG model: dynamical phase transitions, closing of the energy gap, Kibble-Zurek-like dynamics, statistics of the order parameter, and excited-state phase transitions. For each experiment we devise a protocol for extracting the relevant properties which does not require any prior knowledge of the system eigenstates, and can therefore be readily extended to higher dimensions or more complicated models. Our results cement high-dimensional transmon qudits as an exciting path towards simulating many-body physics."}

This work describes a method to study the electrical noise transfer of current driver sources to the intensity noise of mid-infrared emission by commercial quantum and interband cascade lasers (QCLs and ICLs, respectively). A current driver with sub-shot electrical noise in a specific frequency range (up to 10 dB below the shot noise level) was developed for this purpose. This enables testing the performance of mid-infrared lasers when driven via such a quiet pump source. By using this novel current driver, we identify the fundamental noise of a QCL and an ICL, that is the laser intensity noise resulting solely from the internal dynamics of the laser under test. The proposed methodology allows us to retrieve the noise transfer function from current to light, showing that the main limitations in observing the quantum properties of the emitted photons come from laser excess noise and poor matching between laser and detection system in terms of bandwidth and optical power. From the analysis of the measured parameters, we highlight current technological limitations and suggest which key features should be optimized in mid-infrared systems for matching the performance required by quantum applications."}

Final doctoral thesis version containing modifications suggested by the referees: Marco G. Genoni, Madalin Guta, and Lukasz Cywinski", "summary": "Quantum entanglement, in the form of spin squeezing, is known to improve the sensitivity of atomic sensors to static or slowly varying fields. Sensing transient events presents a distinct challenge, requires different analysis tools, and has not been shown to benefit from entanglement in practically important scenarios such as spin-precession magnetometry. To address this, we apply concepts from continuous quantum measurements and estimation theory to optical atomic magnetometers, aiming to accurately model these devices, interpret their measurement data, control their dynamics, and achieve optimal sensitivity. Quantifying this optimal performance requires determining a fundamental quantum limit on sensitivity. We derive this limit, imposed by noise, and show that it scales at best linearly with sensing time and atom number N, ruling out any super-classical scaling. This limit is independent of the initial state, measurement, estimator, and measurement-based feedback, and depends only on the decoherence model and the strength of field fluctuations. Thus, finding an estimator that attains this bound proves the sensing strategy optimal. To approach this limit, we develop a quantum dynamical model scalable with N, based on a co-moving Gaussian approximation of the stochastic master equation, which includes measurement backaction and decoherence. This enables a real-time estimation and control architecture integrating an extended Kalman filter with a linear quadratic regulator. Simulating the magnetometer with our model and EKF+LQR strategy shows that quantum-limited tracking of constant and fluctuating fields is within reach of current atomic magnetometers. Our sensing strategy can also track biologically relevant signals, such as heartbeat-like waveforms, and drive the atomic ensemble into an entangled state, even when the measurement record is used for feedback but later discarded."}

Starting from a microscopic Lagrangian for a relativistic electron beam coupled to a single radiation mode, we construct a Keldysh functional integral, perform the large-N rescaling, and integrate out the electronic degrees of freedom. This yields an effective action for the FEL mode in which dispersion, gain, and noise are all generated by a single electronic self-energy built from the current correlations of the beam. For a stationary Gaussian beam, we obtain closed analytic expressions for the retarded and Keldysh components of the self-energy, which directly encode frequency pulling, gain reduction due to energy spread, and the noise spectrum experienced by the field. At low frequency, the theory reduces to a Landau-Ginzburg-Keldysh description of a single complex mode with a mass, growth rate, nonlinearity, and noise strength fully determined by beam current, energy spread, and detuning. In this framework, the FEL threshold appears as a continuous non-equilibrium phase transition in the laser universality class: the coherent field amplitude plays the role of an order parameter, while the amplitude of critical fluctuations is fixed by the microscopic noise kernel. The result is a minimal open quantum field theory analog of Vlasov-Maxwell FEL theory, in which gain, dispersion, and noise arise from a unified self-energy framework rather than from separate phenomenological ingredients."}

Our work combines room-temperature randomized benchmarking with a new class of composite pulses that are simultaneously robust to frequency and amplitude, affecting random and systematic errors.

Surprisingly, we show that the tendency toward a collective spin description need not imply collective spin phenomena; rather, it can be exploited to generate new forms of strongly correlated quantum matter. The key idea is to use uniform cavity-mediated interactions to energetically project the system into the total-spin singlet sector ($S=0$) - a highly entangled subspace where the physics is governed entirely by cavity fluctuations. Focusing on Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a single-mode cavity, we show that global cavity fluctuations can effectively squeeze classical antiferromagnets into quantum spin liquids, characterized by non-local entanglement, fractionalized excitations, and emergent gauge fields. This work suggests that cavity QED can be a surprising resource for inducing strongly correlated phenomena, which could be explored in the new generation of hybrid tweezer-cavity platforms."}

In this approach we consider all possible configurations in the surroundings of a local observable, and unique samples from the remaining of the setup drawn using Markov chain Monte Carlo. We have tested the performance of this approach for ground states of the spin-1/2 tilted Ising model in different phases, and also for thermal states in the a spin-1 bilinear-biquadratic model.

Our algorithm is conceptually simple and easy to implement. Classical simulation for fidelity estimation shows that our algorithm enjoys much stronger robustness than [HKP20] under adversarial noise.

Here, we relax this constraint by extending the protocol of Navarathna et al. that transfers optical quantum information onto a mechanical resonator using a broadband, sideband-unresolved cavity and feedback. Combining this with parametric mechanical-to-microwave conversion, we show that continuous optical-to-microwave quantum state transfer is possible using measurement-based feedback, while all-optical coherent feedback enables bidirectional transfer. To assess the transfer, we introduce the quantum transfer witness $\\mathcal{W}_T$, which -- though similar to the input-referred added noise -- also identifies whether a channel is capable of both preserving Gaussian entanglement and outperforming classical transduction schemes. Finally, we show that quantum-compatible noise performance is within reach of current experimental capabilities.

In order to compensate for the deviation from the initial conditions, the classical parameters of the system Hamiltonian are affected by the actuator output of a measurement-based classical controller. The latter uses an observation process produced by a measuring apparatus from the quantum output field of the memory system. The underlying system is modelled as an open quantum harmonic oscillator whose Heisenberg evolution is governed by linear Hudson-Parthasarathy quantum stochastic differential equations. The controller is organised as a classical linear time-varying system, so that the resulting closed-loop system has quantum and classical dynamic variables. We apply linear-quadratic-Gaussian control and fixed-point smoothing at the level of the first two moments and consider controllers with a separation structure which involve a continuously updated estimate for the initial quantum variables. The initial-point smoother is used for actuator signal formation so as to minimise the sum of a mean-square deviation of the quantum memory system variables at a given time horizon from their initial values and an integral quadratic penalty on the control signal."}

In discrete, odd-dimensional systems (qudits), protocols involving only non-negative phase space distributions can be efficiently classically simulated. For bosonic systems, defined in continuous variables, phase space negativities are likewise necessary to prevent efficient classical simulation of the underlying physical processes. However, when quantum information is encoded in bosonic systems, this connection becomes subtler: as negativity is only a necessary property for potential quantum advantage, encoding (i.e., physical) states may exhibit large negativities while still corresponding to architectures that remain classically simulable. Several frameworks have attempted to relate non-negativity of states and gates in the computational phase space to non-negativity of processes in the physical bosonic phase space, but a consistent correspondence remains elusive. Here, we introduce a general framework that connects the physical phase space structure of bosonic systems to their encoded computational representations across arbitrary dimensions and encodings. This framework highlights the key role of the reference frame-equivalently, the choice of vacuum-in defining the computational basis and linking its phase space simulability properties to those of the physical system. Finally, we provide computational and physical interpretations of the planar (quadrature-like) phase space limit, where genuinely quantum features may gradually vanish, yielding classically simulable behavior."}

Surprisingly, we show that the tendency toward a collective spin description need not imply collective spin phenomena; rather, it can be exploited to generate new forms of strongly correlated quantum matter. The key idea is to use uniform cavity-mediated interactions to energetically project the system into the total-spin singlet sector ($S=0$) - a highly entangled subspace where the physics is governed entirely by cavity fluctuations. Focusing on Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a single-mode cavity, we show that global cavity fluctuations can effectively squeeze classical antiferromagnets into quantum spin liquids, characterized by non-local entanglement, fractionalized excitations, and emergent gauge fields. This work suggests that cavity QED can be a surprising resource for inducing strongly correlated phenomena, which could be explored in the new generation of hybrid tweezer-cavity platforms."}

Existing randomness analysis lacks rigorous adversarial models and a clear characterization of the role of quantum coherence in these systems. In this work, we develop a comprehensive quantum information-theoretic framework for randomness generation in spontaneous emission processes. We characterize two distinct eavesdropping strategies: one where the adversary directly accesses the atom ensemble, and the other where the adversary accesses only its purification. Our analysis reveals that when randomness is generated through single-photon detection and temporal mode measurements, the QRNG is vulnerable to the first adversary scenario, though it still guarantees a lower bound on intrinsic randomness against the second adversary scenario even under maximal information leakage from the atoms. In contrast, QRNGs based on spatial mode detection and phase fluctuations demonstrate security against both types of adversaries, providing robust randomness generation. Furthermore, we provide a quantitative calculation of intrinsic randomness for these spontaneous-emission-based QRNG schemes."}

We introduce and analyze assisted quantum erasure, where correlations with a remote system reduce the energetic cost of resetting a memory. We identify exclusive control of erasure as the central operational requirement: only a designated party should be able to achieve the minimal cost, while any adversary necessarily fails. In the device-dependent regime, we show that entanglement of formation exactly characterizes exclusivity, establishing entanglement as the decisive thermodynamic resource. Moving to a one-sided device-independent scenario, in which only the memory holder's device is trusted, we develop an operational erasure protocol based on random dephasing and conditional operations. These results elevate quantum erasure from a thermodynamic constraint to an operational primitive: the erasure work cost quantifies secure, exclusive control over quantum memory, guaranteeing that an unauthorized agent cannot fully erase information under bounded work."}

Accurately predicting the performance of these devices from first principles is challenging, as it requires solving the many-body Schrödinger equation. This work introduces a new, general ab-initio method for analyzing large quantum circuits based on lattice field theory, a tool commonly applied in nuclear and particle physics. This method is competitive with state-of-the-art techniques such as tensor networks, but avoids introducing systematic errors due to truncation of the infinite-dimensional Hilbert space associated with superconducting phases. The approach is applied to fluxonium, a specific many-component superconducting qubit with favorable qualities for quantum computation. A systematic study of the influence of impedance on fluxonium is conducted that parallels previous experimental studies, and ground capacitance effects are explored. The qubit frequency and charge noise dephasing rate are extracted from statistical analyses of charge noise, where thousands of instantiations of charge disorder in the Josephson junction array of a fixed fluxonium qubit are explicitly averaged over at the microscopic level. This is difficult to achieve with any other existing method."}

Existing multi-time frameworks, such as process matrices, allow for an arbitrary sequence of operations to be applied on a general process, but are restricted to interventions at discrete times and cannot represent measurements of finite duration. We introduce a continuous-time extension of multi-time quantum processes based on process and operation functionals, which generalize the Feynman-Vernon influence functional and yield a continuous Born rule that cleanly separates processes from operations. This framework provides a consistent representation of non-Markovian dynamics under continuous monitoring and leads to a natural definition of Markovianity in continuous time. We illustrate the formalism by analyzing continuous measurements in a generalized Caldeira-Leggett model, demonstrating its applicability to realistic non-Markovian scenarios."}

Although narrowband techniques can probe specific resonances with high precision, a broadband spectroscopic approach captures the full spectrum of defect properties and dynamics. Two-level system (TLS) defects in amorphous dielectrics are a particularly important example because they are major sources of decoherence and energy loss in superconducting quantum devices. However, accessing and characterizing their collective dynamics remains far more challenging than probing individual TLS defects. Building on our previously developed Broadband Cryogenic Transient Dielectric Spectroscopy (BCTDS) technique, we study the coherent control and time-resolved dynamics of TLS defect ensembles over a wide frequency range of 3-5 GHz without requiring full device fabrication, revealing quantum interference effects, memory-dependent dynamics, and dressed-state evolution within the TLS defect bath. The spectral response reveals distinct V-shaped structures corresponding to the bare eigenmode frequencies. Using these features, we extract a TLS defect spectral density of 84 GHz^-1 for a silicon sample, across a 4.1-4.6 GHz span. Furthermore, we systematically investigate amplitude- and phase-controlled interference fringes for multiple temperatures and inter-pulse delays, providing direct evidence of coherent dynamics and control. A driven minimal spin model with dipole-dipole interactions that qualitatively capture the observed behavior is presented. Our results establish BCTDS as a versatile platform for broadband defect spectroscopy, offering new capabilities for diagnosing and mitigating sources of decoherence, engineering many-body dynamics, and exploring non-equilibrium phenomena in disordered quantum systems."}

The Dyson equation for the cavity photon propagator in the random-phase approximation yields a complex self-energy S that accounts for both the renormalization and the damping of hybrid plasmon-photon modes (polaritons, in a quasi-particle description). Tracing out the electronic and photonic environments leads to a Liouvillian for the upper (UP) and lower (LP) polaritonic branches, incorporating leakage through the imaginary part of the self-energy, internal UP-LP scattering rates, and dephasing. Time evolution equations for polariton populations, interbranch coherence, and driven amplitudes in closed form also provide analytic expressions for their steady-state values, the quench rate of UP-LP oscillations and polaritonic lineshapes, valid in the limit of low polaritonic density, but covering light-matter ultrastrong coupling. The theory establishes a self-consistent description of dissipative polariton dynamics in plasmonic and nanophotonic cavities, directly applicable to response spectra, time-domain measurements, and dissipation engineering."}

Traditional pulse characterization techniques rely on nonlinear optical processes that require high peak powers, making them unsuitable for the attojoule-to-femtojoule regime relevant to quantum photonics. Our approach utilizes a wavelength-to-time mapping method in which the arrival times of spectrally filtered components of a broadband pulse are recorded using a superconducting nanowire single-photon detector and correlated via a high-resolution time-tagging system. The resulting linear relationship between wavelength and arrival time directly yields the dispersion parameter and, subsequently, the GDD. Beyond single-emitter excitation, this technique can be applied in areas such as single-photon spectroscopy, ultralow-power optical communications, and time-domain quantum control, where linear and non-destructive dispersion characterization is essential."}

Such a detuning plays the role of an effective rotational frequency, causing the generation of a synthetic magnetic field. Through scanning the detuning gradient, we numerically obtain static vortex lattice structures containing 1 to 6 vortices using the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations. When quenching detuning gradient below its initial value, the vortex lattices exhibit interesting periodic rotation motion, and their dynamical stability can persist for up to 1000ms. In particular, depending on the detuning gradient, the twin vortices exhibit either a scissors-like rotational oscillation or a clockwise periodic rotation, reflecting the response to the magnetic field gradient experienced by the condensates. We fit the numerical results to quantitatively analyze the relation between rotation dynamics and magnetic field gradients. When quenching the detuning gradient beyond its initial value, additional vortices appear. Our findings may motivate further experimental studies of vortex dynamics in synthetic magnetic fields and offer insights for engineering a BEC-based magnetic field gradiometer."}
