In the\nfirst algorithm, we use the matrix exponentiation method (Patel et al., 2018),\nwhile in the second algorithm, we repurpose the quantum spectral method (Childs\net al., 2020). Our main technical contribution is to derive the sufficient\nconditions for the diagonalization of the Carleman embedding matrix, which is\nindispensable for designing both quantum algorithms. We supplement this with an\nefficient iterative algorithm to diagonalize the Carleman matrix.\n  Our first algorithm has gate complexity of\nO(d$\\cdot$log(d)+T$\\cdot$polylog(T/$\\varepsilon$)). Here $d$ is the size of the\nCarleman matrix, $T$ is the simulation time, and $\\varepsilon$ is the\napproximation error.

This equivalence is not approximate or analogical\nbut mathematically identical to first order in $U/v$, sharing the same form\ndiscovered by Fresnel in 1818 for light in moving transparent media. We\ndemonstrate that all three systems-bubble acoustics, optical drag, and\nrelativistic velocity addition-are described by a universal partial entrainment\nequation where wave coupling to compliant components determines the drag\ncoefficient. In bubbly liquids this physics is directly observable: waves\ncouple to compressible bubbles rather than rigid liquid. Since bubble dynamics\nreproduces the relativistic result, velocity addition itself admits mechanical\ninterpretation. Von Laue's 1907 derivation abstracted mechanics into\nkinematics; we reverse this, showing relativistic effects preserve mechanical\ncontent in abstract form. Beyond first-order equivalence, we show Fresnel's\ndispersive term encodes group velocity (energy transport) versus phase velocity\n(wave-crest motion)-a distinction mechanical models naturally capture but pure\nkinematic velocity addition cannot address. The rigidity-based interpretation\nof dispersion, established in acoustic metamaterials, provides cross-domain\ninsights for materials design and suggests testable predictions linking\nacoustic compliance to optical drag. This three-way equivalence reduces\nindependent phenomena to a single principle: waves riding compliant inclusions.\nFresnel drag, Lorentz contraction, and atomic polarization all emerge as\naspects of this one mechanism, traced through the historical\ndensity-versus-rigidity fork that shaped aether theory's trajectory.

It builds on the Subset-Sum\nLinear Programming (SSLP) framework (arXiv:2504.20847), which partitions basis\nstrings by modular residues and enforces $Z$-marginal Knill-Laflamme (KL)\nequalities via small LPs. The workflow is powered by GPT-5 and implemented\nwithin TeXRA (https://texra.ai)-a multi-agent research assistant platform that\nsupports an iterative tool-use loop agent and a derivation-then-edit workflow\nreasoning agent. We work in a LaTeX-Python environment where agents reason,\nedit documents, execute code, and synchronize their work to Git/Overleaf.\nWithin this workspace, three roles collaborate: a Synthesis Agent formulates\nthe problem; a Search Agent sweeps/screens candidates and exactifies numerics\ninto rationals; and an Audit Agent independently checks all KL equalities and\nthe induced logical action. As a first step we focus on distance $d=2$ with\nnondegenerate residues. For code dimension $K\\in\\{2,3,4\\}$ and $n\\le6$ qubits,\nsystematic sweeps yield certificate-backed tables cataloging attainable cyclic\nlogical groups-all realized by new codes-e.g., for $K=3$ we obtain order $16$\nat $n=6$. From verified instances, Synthesis Agent abstracts recurring\nstructures into closed-form families and proves they satisfy the KL equalities\nfor all parameters. It further demonstrates that SSLP accommodates residue\ndegeneracy by exhibiting a new $((6,4,2))$ code implementing the transversal\ncontrolled-phase $diag(1,1,1,i)$. Overall, the workflow recasts\ndiagonal-transversal feasibility as an analytical pipeline executed at scale,\ncombining systematic enumeration with exact analytical reconstruction. It\nyields reproducible code constructions, supports targeted extensions to larger\n$K$ and higher distances, and leads toward data-driven classification."}

We\nreport a constant-cost of no more than four applications of such Clifford\nentangling multiqubit gates to realize any sequence of Clifford operations of\nany length, without ancillae, which is the theoretically optimal gate count\ncost. We do this by implementing any sequence of CNOT gates of any length with\nfour applications of such gates, without ancillae, and show that the extension\nto general Clifford operations incurs no additional cost.

Comments welcome", "summary": "The problem of quantum state classification asks how accurately one can\nidentify an unknown quantum state that is promised to be drawn from a known set\nof pure states. In this work, we introduce the notion of $k$-learnability,\nwhich captures the ability to identify the correct state using at most $k$\nguesses, with zero error. We show that deciding whether a given family of\nstates is $k$-learnable can be solved via semidefinite programming. When there\nare $n$ states, we present polynomial-time (in $n$) algorithms for determining\n$k$-learnability for two cases: when $k$ is a fixed constant or the dimension\nof the states is a fixed constant. When both $k$ and the dimension of the\nstates are part of the input, we prove that there exist succinct certificates\nplacing the problem in NP, and we establish NP-hardness by a reduction from the\nclassical $k$-clique problem. Together, our findings delineate the boundary\nbetween efficiently solvable and intractable instances of quantum state\nclassification in the perfect (zero-error) regime."}

In our method, feature\nrelevance-measured via mutual information with the target-is encoded as local\ndetuning amplitudes, while feature redundancy is embedded through\ndistance-dependent van der Waals interactions, constrained by the Rydberg\nblockade radius. The system is evolved adiabatically toward low-energy\nconfigurations, and the resulting measurement bitstrings are used to extract\nphysically consistent subsets of features. The protocol is evaluated through\nsimulations on three benchmark binary classification datasets: Adult Income,\nBank Marketing, and Telco Churn. Compared to classical methods such as mutual\ninformation ranking and Boruta, combined with XGBoost and Random Forest\nclassifiers, our quantum-computing approach achieves competitive or superior\nperformance. In particular, for compact subsets of 2-5 features, analog QFS\nimproves mean AUC scores by 1.5-2.3% while reducing the number of features by\n75-84%, offering interpretable, low-redundancy solutions. These results\ndemonstrate that programmable Rydberg arrays offer a viable platform for\nintelligent feature selection with practical relevance in machine learning\npipelines, capable of transforming computational quantum advantage into\nindustrial quantum usefulness."}
