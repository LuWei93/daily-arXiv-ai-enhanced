Here we extend this computations\nto higher orders: assuming that the only relevant parameter specifying the\ninteraction potential is the $s$-wave scattering length $a_0$, we compute the\ncomplete order $(k_{\\rm F}a_0)^3$ ($k_{\\rm F}$ is the Fermi wave vector)\ncontribution to the system's free energy as a function of the numbers $N_+$ and\n$N_-$ of spin up and spin down fermions (i.e. as a function of its\npolarization) and the temperature $T$. We also extend the computation beyond a\nfixed order by resumming the contributions to $F$ of two infinite sets of\nFeynman diagrams: the so called particle-particle rings and the particle-hole\nrings.

In this work, we introduce a\nvariational framework that leverages matrix product states for the efficient\nclassical evaluation of the Helmholtz free energy, combining scalable\nentanglement entropy computation with a hardware efficient ansatz to accurately\napproximate thermal states in one- and two-dimensional systems. We conduct\nextensive benchmarking on key observables, including energy density,\nsusceptibility, specific heat, and two-point correlations, comparing against\nexact analytical results for 1D systems and quantum Monte Carlo simulations for\n2D lattices across various temperatures and ansatz configurations. Our\nlarge-scale numerical simulations demonstrate the capability to prepare\nhigh-quality Gibbs states for 1D lattice models with up to 30 sites and 2D\nsystems with up to 6x6 sites, using up to 42 qubits. Finally, we demonstrate\nthe framework's practical viability on a 156-qubit IBM Heron processor by\npreparing the approximate Gibbs state of a 30-site transverse-field Ising\nmodel. Leveraging a combination of error mitigation techniques, we reduce the\nrelative errors in energy and susceptibility measurements by over 50% compared\nto unmitigated results."}

To overcome\nthis limitation, we propose experiment-friendly schemes to measure\ncharge-off-diagonal correlations (such as currents). Our protocols use\nnon-interacting dynamics for random times followed by standard quantum gas\nmicroscope measurements to effectively measure in random bases. The main\nrequirement of our scheme is the ability to turn off interactions, which can be\ndone in many atomic species using Feshbach resonances. Importantly, our scheme\nrequires no local control and otherwise also exhibits modest requirements in\nterms of total evolution time and number of repetitions. We numerically\ndemonstrate efficient estimation of bilinear correlation functions, requiring\nless than $4000$ samples to measure local currents to 5% error (system-size\nindependent) and $\\sim 10^4$ samples to simultaneously measure all non-local\ncorrelations in 70-site systems.

The confinement potential is not assumed a priori,\nbut emerges as a radial effective potential, analogous to a quantum dot,\ngeometrically induced by the torsion of the material. Starting from an\neffective radial equation derived in a nontrivial geometric background, we\nanalytically solve for the energy spectrum and wave functions. These solutions\nare then employed to evaluate the optical absorption coefficients and\nrefractive index changes, including both linear and third-order nonlinear\ncontributions. The formalism incorporates the electric dipole approximation and\naccounts for intensity-dependent effects such as saturation and spectral\nshifts. Our results reveal that torsion and topological parameters\nsignificantly modify the optical response, leading to tunable resonances and\nnontrivial dispersive behavior.

Using standard input output\ntheory and measurements on single port bare microwave cavities and cavity\nmagnon hybrids, we find that CPA drives the on resonance reflection to zero\nwhile the spectral width remains set by the total decay rate. Apparent\nnarrowing observed near CPA is found to be a visual artifact that does not\nremain upon quantitative analysis. Extending the analysis to cavity\nmagnomechanics, we show that logarithmic plots can exhibit apparent\npolaromechanical normal mode splitting, whereas linear scale spectra display no\ntrue splitting. These results clarify when CPA modifies amplitudes versus\nspectral poles, offer practical guidance for data presentation, and indicate\nthat CPA alone is not a route to linewidth suppression or polaromechanical mode\nsplitting in the linear, weak-probe regime."}

Valuable\ninsight comes from examining how few-body correlations manifest in many-body\nsystems, embodying the ``from few to many'' philosophy. An intriguing example\nis the set of universal relations in ultracold atomic gases, which connect a\nwide range of observables to a single quantity known as the contact. In this\nLetter, we demonstrate that universal relations manifest in a distinct class of\nquantum many-body systems, long-range quantum spin chains, which belong to a\ncompletely new universality class. Using effective field theory and the\noperator product expansion, we establish connections between the asymptotic\nbehavior of equal-time spin correlation functions, the dynamical structure\nfactor, and the contact density. The theoretical predictions for equal-time\ncorrelators are explicitly verified through numerical simulations based on\nmatrix product states.

Here,\nwe propose a simple and efficient experimental protocol that can be used to\nmeasure any potential with high precision. The key ingredient in our protocol\nis the ability in some atomic species to turn off interactions using a Feshbach\nresonance, which makes the evolution easy to compute.
