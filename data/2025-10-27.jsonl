Miller (1991),\ndiffers from an ordinary (\"spatial\") dipole source in that the inverted\nmonopole is delayed relative to the uninverted monopole, the delay being equal\nto the propagation time from one monopole to the other. A \"generalized\"\nspatiotemporal dipole (GSTD), as defined here, is generalized in two ways:\nfirst, the delay may be smaller in absolute value (but not larger) than the\npropagation time, so that the radiated waves cancel at a certain angle from the\naxis of the dipole; second, one monopole may be attenuated relative to the\nother, so that the cancellation is exact at a finite distance - on a circle\ncoaxial with the dipole.\n  I show that the Kirchhoff integral theorem, for a single monopole primary\nsource, gives the same wave function as a certain distribution of GSTD\nsecondary sources on the surface of integration. In the GSTDs, the\n\"generalized\" delay allows the surface of integration to be general (not\nnecessarily a primary wavefront), whereas the attenuation allows an exact match\nof the wave function even in the near field of the primary source. At each\npoint on the surface of integration, the circle of cancellation of the GSTD\nsecondary source passes through the primary source, which therefore receives no\nbackward secondary waves, while the direction of specular reflection of the\nprimary wave passes through the same circle, giving a geometrical-optical\nexplanation of the suppression of backward secondary waves at any field point."}

In this work, we construct a bridge between DV and CV\nsystems by means of the tomographic probability representation of quantum\nstates complemented by the Jordan-Schwinger map. We connect observable random\nvariables such as spin projections, photon numbers, or quadratures arising in\nDV and CV architectures through their probabilistic representations, namely\nspin, photon-number, and symplectic tomograms, as well as the Wigner function.\nThis makes it possible to directly obtain the tomogram in one architecture from\nmeasurement data in another, thereby reconstructing the corresponding state\nacross representations realizing similar statistics. The proposed formalism\nenables a unified framework for comparing and transferring quantum information\nacross different hardware platforms. This facilitates the design of hybrid\nprotocols where, for example, spin-based quantum memories interface with\nphotonic communication channels or CV bosonic codes. It also provides a\npractical tool for benchmarking quantum devices, validating algorithms across\nheterogeneous architectures, and exploring error correction schemes that rely\non mappings between finite- and infinite-dimensional systems."}
