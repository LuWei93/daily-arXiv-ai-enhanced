Despite ultra-high precision, security, particularly the unresolved vulnerabilities on physical links beyond traditional cryptography, remains the bottleneck. Here, we develop an analysis framework, the Benchmark Attack Noise Detection (BAND) model, to quantify the security of the high-precision time synchronization when its core assumption, reciprocity, is broken. The model characterizes non-reciprocal attacks through a unified metric, termed attack intensity. Based on the analysis of attack intensity, we accurately predict both instantaneous and accumulating attacks in a 100-km dual-comb two-way time-transfer system. Beyond security considerations, we find that the BAND model can explain intrinsic fiber noise and delay-unsuppressed noise naturally, offering an effective tool to establish an environment-sensitive link model. This work paves the way for a secure large-scale integrated time, sensing and communication networks."}

However, so far on-chip gas sensing based on traditional laser absorption spectroscopy has demonstrated low detection sensitivity, due to weak light-gas interaction over a limited interaction distance. On-chip photothermal spectroscopy (PTS) appears to be a powerful technique to achieve higher sensitivity, its performance is yet constrained to parts-per-million (ppm)-level due to small fraction of evanescent field in the light-gas interaction zone and fast thermal dissipation through the solid substrate. Herein, we demonstrated suspended chalcogenide glass waveguide (ChGW)-enhanced PTS that overcomes these limitations, enabling highly sensitive parts-per-billion (ppb)-level molecular gas sensing. We fabricated a nanoscale suspended ChGW with low loss of 2.6 dB/cm using CMOS-compatible two-step patterning process. By establishing an equivalent PTS model to guide the optimization of the ChGW geometry, we achieved a 4-fold increase in the absorption-induced heat source power and a 10.6-fold decrease in the equivalent heat conductivity, resulting in a 45-fold enhancement in photothermal phase modulation efficiency over the non-suspended waveguides. Combining with a high-contrast waveguide facet-formed Fabry-Perot interferometer, we achieved an unprecedented acetylene detection limit of 330 ppb, a large dynamic range close to 6 orders of magnitude, and a fast response of less than 1 s. The overall system exhibits a noise-equivalent absorption coefficient of 3.8x10-7 cm-1, setting a new benchmark for photonic waveguide gas sensors to the best of our knowledge. This work provides a key advancement towards prototyping an integrated sensor-on-a-chip for highly sensitive and background-free photonic sensing applications."}

In the low-lying regime, we characterize realistic circumstances in which there is a breakdown of the expected scale invariance so that the collective excitations follow hydrodynamic theory instead of the predictions given by SO(2,1) conformal symmetry. In the high energy regime, we focus on important trap effects associated with acoustic oscillations which have been of interest experimentally. This comprehensive analysis of the collective excitations in trapped two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates is experimentally accessible.

Through dimensional reduction, the robust bulk band topology of, e.g., the integer quantum Hall system can be mapped onto similarly robust charge-pumping dynamics of a topological pump living in one lower dimension. Recent studies have uncovered a rich influence of interactions on the dynamics of topological pumps in nonlinear systems, including the robust pumping of self-bound solitons. These striking observations in classical nonlinear photonics have raised a number of questions, chiefly if and how this phenomenology persists in strongly correlated quantum systems and in the few-body limit. Here, using few- and many-atom arrays, we explore how dipolar interactions impact the dynamics of topological population pumping along a Rydberg synthetic dimension. In the few-body limit, we find that dipolar interactions lead to self-bound states that are efficiently pumped along the synthetic dimension, described by an emergent pair-state topological pump. We find that this interaction-assisted pumping persists in many-atom arrays, with a sharpened dependence on the dipolar interaction strength that stems from the enhanced spatial connectivity. These Rydberg-based studies on interaction-assisted topological pumping help connect observations from classical nonlinear photonics to the few-body quantum limit and pave the way for studies of new strongly correlated quantum pumping phenomena."}

Recent advances in deep learning have greatly improved CGH in reconstructed quality and computational efficiency. However, deploying neural CGH pipelines directly on compact, eyeglass-style devices is hindered by stringent constraints on computation and energy consumption, while cloud offloading followed by transmission with natural image codecs often distorts phase information and requires high bandwidth to maintain reconstruction quality. Neural compression methods can reduce bandwidth but impose heavy neural decoders at the edge, increasing inference latency and hardware demand. In this work, we introduce JPEG-Inspired Cloud-Edge Holography, an efficient pipeline designed around a learnable transform codec that retains the block-structured and hardware-friendly nature of JPEG. Our system shifts all heavy neural processing to the cloud, while the edge device performs only lightweight decoding without any neural inference. To further improve throughput, we implement custom CUDA kernels for entropy coding on both cloud and edge. This design achieves a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 32.15 dB at $<$ 2 bits per pixel with decode latency as low as 4.2 ms. Both numerical simulations and optical experiments confirm the high reconstruction quality of the holograms. By aligning CGH with a codec that preserves JPEG's structural efficiency while extending it with learnable components, our framework enables low-latency, bandwidth-efficient hologram streaming on resource-constrained wearable devices-using only simple block-based decoding readily supported by modern system-on-chips, without requiring neural decoders or specialized hardware."}

We bring this idea back to one dimension by introducing a holographic isoTNS ansatz: a (1+1)-dimensional lattice of isometric tensors where the horizontal axis encodes physical space and an auxiliary \"holographic\" axis boosts expressivity. Despite the enlarged geometry, contractions and local updates remain computationally efficient due to isometric constraints. We investigate this ansatz and benchmark it in comparison to matrix product states (MPS). First, we show that randomly initialized holographic isoTNS typically display volume-law entanglement even at modest bond dimension, surpassing the representational limits of MPS and related ansätze. Second, through analytic constructions and variational optimization, we demonstrate that holographic isoTNS can faithfully represent arbitrary fermionic Gaussian states, Clifford states, and certain short-time-evolved states under local evolution -- a family of states that is highly entangled but low in complexity. Third, to exploit this expressivity in broad situations, we implement a time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm on holographic isoTNS. While the method remains efficient and scalable, error accumulation over TEBD sweeps suppresses entanglement and leads to rapid deviations from exact dynamics. Overall, holographic isoTNS broaden the reach of tensor-network methods, opening new avenues to study physics in the volume-law regime."}

Yet, the established theory applies only to uniform MPS with periodic boundary conditions, leaving many physically relevant states beyond its reach. Here we introduce a generalized canonical form for uniform MPS with a boundary matrix, thus extending the analytical MPS framework to a more general setting of wider physical significance. This canonical form reveals that any such MPS can be represented as a block-invertible matrix product operator acting on a structured class of algebraic regular language states that capture its essential long-range and scale-invariant features. Our construction builds on new algebraic results of independent interest that characterize the span and algebra generated by non-semisimple sets of matrices, including a generalized quantum Wielandt's inequality that gives an explicit upper bound on the blocking length at which the fixed-length span stabilizes to an algebra. Together, these results establish a unified theoretical foundation for uniform MPS with boundaries, bridging the gap between periodic and arbitrary-boundary settings, and providing the basis for extending key analytical and classification results of matrix product states to a much broader class of states and operators."}

In this work we first extend the proof techniques developed in previous works for proving the convergence of the cumulant expansion in periodic systems to the non-periodic case. A key equation used to analyze the sum of connected Feynman diagrams, which we call the tree-determinant expansion, reveals an underlying tree structure in the summation.

Recently, PECD was explored with polarization-tailored light such as bi-chromatic and non-collinear drivers, which still produces significant chiral signals. Yet, all known PECD configurations to date exhibit non-zero time-local chirality. That is, they are driven by an intrinsically helical light source. Nonetheless, 'chiral' light can also be non-helical if its chirality manifests on longer timescales (e.g. an optical centrifuge). It remains unknown whether PECD can arise from non-helical coherent light. Here we predict that PECD indeed emerges from non-helical light by employing a train of linearly-polarized intense laser pulses with a rotating polarization axis, which are phase-coherent and time-delayed. We find strong PECD in the model chiral molecule CBrClFH under a wide parameter regime that can be optimized up to ~8% by tuning delays between pulses, suggesting quantum interference. We directly show that the physical mechanism for this type of PECD differs from the standard case, relying on a chiral hole attosecond wave-packet evolving in the molecule, induced by the first linear pulse. Our work shows that multiple mechanisms can give rise to PECD on longer timescales and provides a novel approach for ultrafast chirality spectroscopy and coherent chiral wave-packet manipulation."}

Such light-matter interactions are often studied with a broad variety of analytical and computational methods that are constrained by approximation techniques or by computational scaling. Quantum processors present a new avenue to address these challenges. We consider the case of cavity mediated two-qubit gates. To investigate quantum state transfer between the qubits, we implement simulations with quantum circuits that are able to reliably track the dynamics of the system. Our quantum algorithm, compatible with NISQ (Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum) era systems, allows us to map out the fidelity of the state transfer operation between qubits as a function of a broad range of system parameters including the respective detunings between the qubits and the cavity, the damping factor of the cavity, and the respective couplings between the qubits and the cavity. The algorithm provides a robust and intuitive solution, alongside a satisfactory agreement with analytical solutions or classical simulation algorithms in their respective regimes of validity. It allows us to identify under-explored regimes of optimal performance, relevant for heterogeneous quantum platforms, where the two-qubit gate can be rather effective between far-detuned qubits that are neither resonant with each other nor with the cavity. Besides its present application, the method introduced in the current paper can be efficiently used in otherwise untractable variations of the model and in various efforts to simulate and optimize photon-mediated two-qubit gates and other relevant operations in quantum information processing."}

The affordability and modularity of the platform enable distributed data acquisition and aggregation into shared repositories, providing a pathway toward continuously improving model generalization, cross-validation and a scalable, community-driven paradigm for biosensing."}

Recently, the spintronic Poisson bolometer was proposed as a promising platform for uncooled infrared detection. The Poisson bolometer operates in a probabilistic regime dominated by Poissonian noise, establishing a new detection paradigm. In contrast to traditional analog detectors, where signal and noise are continuous currents or voltages, the Poisson bolometer has both signal and noise governed by Poissonian counting statistics regardless of the light source, with the mean count rate modulated by incident radiation. In this work, we integrate a broadband plasmonic absorber optimized for LWIR absorption onto a spintronic Poisson bolometer to enhance thermal coupling and temperature rise in the sensing layer. The plasmonic absorber achieves over 60\\% absorptance across the LWIR spectrum, matching the blackbody radiation peak at room temperature. The device exhibits a best noise-equivalent temperature difference (NEDT) of 35 mK at a 50 Hz frame rate and multiple results close to or below 100 mK, demonstrating room-temperature performance among the most sensitive uncooled LWIR detectors reported to date.

This demands an enormous number of execution shots, making practical use prohibitively expensive. We observe that VQA costs can be significantly reduced by exploiting execution similarities across an application's tasks. Based on this insight, we propose TreeVQA, a tree-based execution framework that begins by executing tasks jointly and progressively branches only as their quantum executions diverge. Implemented as a VQA wrapper, TreeVQA integrates with typical VQA applications.

By subtracting the Gaussian beam shape and removing contributions from uninformative noise simultaneously from the set of images, we can reconstruct the normalized intensity fluctuations. Our analysis demonstrates that nitrogen gas within microvolume can be rapidly monitored under ambient conditions in less than 0.2 seconds.

HNG gate typically requires a QC of 12 and a logical depth of 5, in the area of classical reversible circuits.

The underlying process is four-wave mixing between an optical signal and a multi-wavelength pump source via optical Kerr nonlinearity. To enhance the generally weak nonlinearity, high-quality (Q) microcavities are commonly used to achieve practical efficiency. However, the ultra-narrow linewidths of high Q cavities prohibit achieving massive throughput broadcasting due to Fourier reciprocity. Here, we overcome this challenge by harnessing a parity-time symmetric coupled-cavity system that supports equally spaced exceptional points in the frequency domain. This design seamlessly integrates generation of dissipative Kerr soliton comb source and all-optical signal broadcasting into a unified nonlinear process. As a result, we realize soliton-assisted intracavity massive signal broadcasting with a channel count exceeding 100 over 200 nm wavelength range, resulting in Terabit-per-second aggregated rates. This throughput surpasses the intrinsic microcavity linewidth constraint (~200 MHz) by over three orders of magnitude. We further demonstrate the utility of this approach through an optical convolutional accelerator, highlighting its potential to enable transformative capabilities in photonic computing.

For example, fully symmetry-adapted universal operator pools typically generate long and deep quantum circuits, gate-efficient universal operator pools generally break symmetries, and gate-efficient fully symmetry-adapted operator pools may not be universal. In this work, we analyze such symmetry dilemmas both theoretically and numerically. On the theory side, we prove that the popular, gate-efficient operator pool consisting of singlet spin-adapted singles and perfect-pairing doubles is not universal when spatial symmetry is enforced. To demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the three types of pools, we perform numerical simulations using an adaptive algorithm paired with operator pools that are (i) fully symmetry-adapted and universal, (ii) fully symmetry-adapted and non-universal, and (iii) breaking a single symmetry and are universal. Our numerical simulations encompass three physically relevant scenarios in which the target state is (i) the global ground state, (ii) the ground state crossed by a state differing in multiple symmetry properties, and (iii) the ground state crossed by a state differing in a single symmetry property. Our results show when symmetry-breaking but universal pools can be used safely, when enforcing at least one distinguishing symmetry suffices, and when a particular symmetry must be rigorously preserved to avoid variational collapse. Together, the formal and numerical analysis provides a practical guide for designing and benchmarking symmetry-adapted operator pools that balance universality, resource requirements, and robust state targeting in quantum simulations for chemistry."}

A lightweight forward prediction network, integrated as a full-wave solver surrogate within the framework, enables efficient end-to-end training of the inverse design network while capturing mutual coupling effects by considering both local and neighboring geometries.The framework's effectiveness is experimentally verified through a multi-foci metalens and a holographic metasurface.

I argue that the deeper conflict is logical: quantum theory is inherently contextual, whereas the classical tradition presupposes a single global, Boolean valuation. Building on Bohr's complementarity, the Einstein--Podolsky--Rosen argument and Bell's theorem, I recast locality and completeness as the existence of a global section of a presheaf of value assignments over the category of measurement contexts. The absence of global sections expresses the impossibility of context-independent description, and Čech cohomology measures the resulting obstruction. The internal logic of the presheaf topos is intuitionistic, and the seven-valued contextual logic proposed by Ghose and Patra is exhibited as a finite Heyting algebra capturing patterns of truth, falsity and indeterminacy across incompatible contexts. Classical physics corresponds to the sheaf case, where compatible local data glue and Boolean logic is effectively restored. Measurement is therefore reinterpreted as sheafification of presheaf-valued truth rather than as a physical breakdown of unitarity. Finally, a $σ$--$λ$ dynamics motivated by stochastic mechanics provides a continuous interpolation between strongly contextual and approximately classical regimes, dissolving the usual measurement paradoxes and apparent nonlocality as artefacts of an illegitimate demand for global truth."}

In practice, however, birefringence-induced transverse walk-off breaks this factorization and couples these degrees of freedom. Here, we show that this coupling persists even for nominally thin crystals once the free-space propagation of the joint spatial intensity is taken into account. This sum-difference coordinate coupling leads to a distinctive tapering of the transverse correlations near the crystal image plane-an effect that standard factorized models cannot capture. Numerical simulations and experimental data clearly confirm this novel behavior.

On aggressively downsampled $4\\times 4$ inputs, Angle encoding attains higher accuracy and remains comparatively robust as noise increases, while the Hybrid encoder trails and exhibits non-monotonic trends. At $8\\times 8$, the Hybrid scheme can overtake Angle under moderate noise, suggesting that mixed phase/angle encoders benefit from additional feature bandwidth. Amplitude-encoded QCNNs are sparsely represented in the downsampled grids but achieve strong performance in lightweight and full-resolution configurations, where training dynamics closely resemble classical convergence. Taken together, these results provide practical guidance for choosing QCNN encoders under joint constraints of resolution, noise strength, and simulation budget."}

Typically, they exhibit eigenvalue splitting that scales as ε^(1/n), which is referred to as the generic response. However, under certain conditions, a nongeneric response of HOEPs occurs where the splitting follows a lower order ε^(1/m) (m<n). A nongeneric response of HOEPs with a lower order splitting lead to the remaining EPs. While the presence of these remaining EPs is acknowledged, a thorough elucidation of their fundamental properties has yet to be achieved. In this work, we demonstrate those unsplit eigenvalue points must constitute remaining EPs in a perturbed n-orders HOEPs system. Combining graph theory and topological analysis, the number and splitting order of the remaining EPs is studied. This framework not only resolves a fundamental challenge in HOEPs but also paves the way for exploiting remaining EPs in applications such as anisotropic sensing and the design of Dirac exceptional points."}

With a constellation of satellites and a set of ground stations in a satellite-based QKD system, how to schedule satellites to achieve efficient QKD is an important problem. This problem has been studied in the dual-downlink architecture, where each satellite distributes pairs of entanglements to two ground stations simultaneously. However, it has not been studied in the single downlink architecture, where satellites create keys with each individual ground station, and then serve as trusted nodes to create keys between pairs of ground stations. While the single downlink architecture provides weaker security in that the satellites need to be trusted, it has many advantages, including the potential of achieving significantly higher key rates, and generating keys between pairs of ground stations that are far away from each other and cannot be served using the dual-downlink architecture. In this paper, we propose a novel opportunistic approach for satellite scheduling that accounts for fairness among the ground station pairs, while taking advantage of the dynamic satellite channels to maximize the system performance. We evaluate this approach in a wide range of settings and demonstrate that it provides the best tradeoffs in terms of total and minimum key rates across the ground station pairs. Our evaluation also highlights the importance of considering seasonal effects and cloud coverage in evaluating satellite-based QKD systems. In addition, we show different tradeoffs in global and regional QKD systems."}

In this work, we collect sunlight and direct it into the laboratory, where it is modulated into a partially coherent probing source and then realize rotational Doppler shift detection. Our study reveals that in low-light conditions, where background noise is stronger than the signal, the superposition of rotational Doppler signals at different wavelengths can significantly enhance the signal strength and improve the signal-to-noise ratio, enabling accurate measurement of the rotational speed of objects. Our research provides experimental validation for the application of sunlight in rotational Doppler shift detection, demonstrating its potential value for passive remote sensing."}

Despite its advantages, the underlying fragmentation mechanisms, their connection to the nanoparticle size distribution, and the energy efficiency of the process remain poorly understood. In this study for the first time, microparticle fragmentation is investigated in single-pulse, single-particle experiments on Au microparticles. Determining the absorbed peak fluence enables assessment of the process energetics. Pump-probe microscopy identifies photomechanical fracture of the molten microparticle volume and photothermal phase explosion of its superheated surface as the fragmentation mechanisms. We find that 83% of the absorbed laser energy is converted into cavitation bubble formation, while only 1% contributes to the surface energy of the generated nanoparticles. Despite this small fraction, MP-LFL outperforms laser ablation in liquids. The surface energy generated per absorbed energy is 10 times higher, and the overall energy efficiency is 14 times higher. This gain originates from the confined microparticle geometry, which minimizes energy losses and enhances photomechanical fragmentation via pressure focusing. These results position microparticle fragmentation in liquids as a fundamentally more energy-efficient approach for scalable, laser-based nanoparticle production than laser ablation in liquids."}

Using hexagonal arrays of silver nanoparticles embedded in dye-doped waveguides, we demonstrate lasing at high-symmetry points of the Brillouin zone, including the K and M points. K-point lasing exhibits spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in relative intensity between degenerate K and K' modes, with no bias induced by pump geometry, even for geometries that explicitly break symmetry. In contrast, M-point lasing allows deterministic control over emission channels via asymmetric pumping. We further show that spatially separated K-point lasers synchronize in phase and amplitude, undergoing SSB in lockstep. A theoretical density matrix approach cast into stochastic differential equations reproduces the observed real- and Fourier-space intensity distributions and SSB behavior. Our findings establish spatially programmable metasurface lasers as a versatile platform for exploring dynamic phenomena in photonic lattices, with potential applications in vortex beam shaping, optical logic, and true random number generation."}

Longitudinal epsilon near zero metamaterials (LENZ), characterized by a vanishing permittivity along the optical axis provide an exceptional platform for field enhancement while mitigating absorption losses and impedance mismatch. We experimentally show that a Si and ITO multilayer engineered for a LENZ resonance in the near-infrared enables broadband, high pump transmission while still harnessing ENZ enhanced nonlinearity to generate a strong third harmonic signal. This demonstrates that efficient nonlinear processes can be driven without the high-loss conditions typical of isotropic ENZ media and regardless of intrinsic absorption at the harmonic frequency. The resulting third harmonic efficiency is comparable to isotropic ENZ films but without the absorption-induced heating constraints of ENZ operation. The high pump transmission enables transparent LENZ (TLENZ) stacks to be integrated into optical cavities, where resonant field buildup could amplify the nonlinear response without compromising thermal management. These results establish TLENZ multilayers as a robust, versatile platform for transparent, field enhanced nonlinear nanophotonics, combining strong light matter interaction with low-loss operation."}

Recent studies in optics and photonics, including coherence tomography, Moire interference, and coherence-engineered diffraction, indicate that phase organization alone can bend light even without index discontinuities. Fraunhofer-based analyses further show that angular deflection can arise from intrinsic phase curvature within homogeneous media. Here we introduce a coherence-based constitutive framework that systematizes these observations: refraction can occur inside a bulk medium when coherence itself provides the effective boundary.\n  Two near-frequency structured beams write and probe a shared phase field, revealing reproducible angular rotation and coherence-lensing whose direction and magnitude follow the spectral detuning.

Using standard reconstruction results, affinity forces the probability assignment to coincide with the quadratic transition function of complex quantum theory. Our three-stage argument (operational assignment, causal-consistency constraints, and structural reconstruction) recovers complex quantum theory and identifies Born's rule as a causal fixed point among admissible probabilistic laws.

While frame-change maps and frame-invariant resource sums are theoretically understood, their impact on circuit-based quantum information processing has largely remained unexplored. We formulate QRF transformations as circuit compilation rules and, for systems with finite Abelian symmetry described by the regular representation, derive a gate-level dictionary that maps local operations in one frame to their images in another. This yields a group-theoretic classification of gates where symmetry-commuting operators remain local, up to frame-dependent phases, while generic gates are promoted to controlled entangling operations in which the original frame acts as a control register. The resulting frame-dependence entangling-gate count defines a relational circuit complexity where the cost of a computation depends on the internal reference frame of the observer. We instantiate the framework in a three-qubit model and show that the QRF unitary acts as a lossless converter between a purity-based local coherence and concurrence, preserving their invariant sum and giving a concrete realization of the relativity of entanglement. We implement the corresponding circuits on an IBM Quantum superconducting platform, using full state tomography to reconstruct the redistribution of resources between internal frames. The hardware data reproduce the predicted conversion of local coherence into entanglement, and the observed deviations from exact conservation quantify the effect of realistic device noise on relational quantum protocols."}

The average maximum CNT thickness widening the bridge edges is, respectively, for SCF1 (2.8 and 2 microns) and SCF2 (1.7 and 1.3 microns).

A wide range of classical machine learning methods, as well as more recent quantum machine learning approaches, have been investigated to address this challenge, each providing valuable progress but also leaving open questions regarding scalability, robustness, and adaptability to evolving fraud patterns. In this work, we introduce the Fidelity-based Quantum Autoencoder (FiD-QAE), a quantum architecture that employs fidelity estimation as the decision criterion for anomaly detection. Transactions are encoded into quantum states, compressed through a variational quantum circuit, and evaluated using the SWAP test to distinguish legitimate from fraudulent transactions. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of FiD-QAE, including statistical analyses, multiple performance metrics, and robustness tests under quantum noise models. The results show that FiD-QAE maintains consistent performance across different imbalance levels and preserves robustness in noisy conditions. Moreover, validation on IBM Quantum hardware backends confirms the feasibility of our approach on real devices, with outcomes consistent with simulation. These findings position quantum fidelity as a powerful criterion for anomaly detection and highlight FiD-QAE as a promising direction that complements existing classical and quantum approaches, offering robustness and generalizability for financial fraud detection in realistic environments."}

On the other hand, space-time wave packets are structured waves whose spatio-temporal spectra lie on tilted space-time planes, so their group velocity can be programmed, including superluminal values, even in a uniform medium. Here we develop a general theory of space-time refraction for such structured waves at a planar moving interface and show how a single boundary reshapes their velocity content. By identifying the invariants of a translating boundary, we obtain refraction laws for baseband, X-wave, and sideband packets that apply for arbitrary interface velocities and connect smoothly to static and purely temporal limits. These laws reveal regimes of \"space-time anomalous optical push broom,\" where a moving interface compresses a wide range of incident velocities into a narrow transmitted band, and \"velocity spectral optical fission,\" where an incident X-wave splits into two propagation-invariant branches with distinct velocities. The combined freedom to prepare waves with superluminal group velocity and to prescribe equally unconstrained interface speeds points toward reconfigurable time gating, optical buffering, velocity multiplexing, and controlled emission in moving media, and provides a route to photonic settings capable of emulating dynamical effects traditionally associated with gravitational or quantum processes."}

Such light-matter interactions are often studied with a broad variety of analytical and computational methods that are constrained by approximation techniques or by computational scaling. Quantum processors present a new avenue to address these challenges. We consider the case of cavity mediated two-qubit gates. To investigate quantum state transfer between the qubits, we implement simulations with quantum circuits that are able to reliably track the dynamics of the system. Our quantum algorithm, compatible with NISQ (Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum) era systems, allows us to map out the fidelity of the state transfer operation between qubits as a function of a broad range of system parameters including the respective detunings between the qubits and the cavity, the damping factor of the cavity, and the respective couplings between the qubits and the cavity. The algorithm provides a robust and intuitive solution, alongside a satisfactory agreement with analytical solutions or classical simulation algorithms in their respective regimes of validity. It allows us to identify under-explored regimes of optimal performance, relevant for heterogeneous quantum platforms, where the two-qubit gate can be rather effective between far-detuned qubits that are neither resonant with each other nor with the cavity. Besides its present application, the method introduced in the current paper can be efficiently used in otherwise untractable variations of the model and in various efforts to simulate and optimize photon-mediated two-qubit gates and other relevant operations in quantum information processing."}

In this paper, the quantum Fourier transform operating with continuous variables (cvQFT) is considered. Thus, the environment becomes the Hilbert space, where the natural definition of the cvQFT will be related to rotation operators, which in the $N$--mode are completely specified by unitary matrices of order $N$. Then the cvQFT is defined as the rotation operator whose rotation matrix is given by the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix. For the implementation of rotation operators with primitive components (single--mode rotations and beam splitters), we follow the well known Murnaghan procedure, with appropriate modifications. Moreover, algorithms related to the fast Fourier transform (FFT) are applied to reduce drastically the implementation complexity. The final part is concerned with the application of the cvQFT to general Gaussian states. In particular, we show that cvQFT has the simple effect of transforming the displacement vector by a one-dimensional DFT, the squeeze matrix by a two-dimensional DFT, and the rotation matrix by a Fourier-like similarity transform."}

However, the evolution of quantum coherence for light beams undergoing fundamental optical processes at dielectric interfaces remains unexplored. Furthermore, manipulating multiphoton correlations typically requires complex interactions that challenge few-photon level implementation. Here, we introduce a quantum van Cittert-Zernike theorem for light beams, describing how their coherence-polarization properties are influenced by reflection and refraction, as well as how these properties evolve upon subsequent propagation. Our work demonstrates that the quantum statistics of photonic systems can be controllably modified through the inherent polarization coupling arising from reflection and refraction at an interface, without relying on conventional light-matter interactions. Our approach reveals regimes where thermal light can exhibit sub-Poissonian statistics with fluctuations below the shot-noise level through post-selected measurements, and this statistical property can be tuned by the incident angle. Remarkably, this quantum statistical modification is governed by a scaling law linking beam collimation to far-field thermalization. Our work establishes a robust, decoherence-avoiding mechanism for quantum state control, advancing the fundamental understanding of coherence in quantum optics and opening new avenues for applications in quantum information and metrology."}

Using the Fermi-Hubbard model on lattices up to 3x3, we show that this breakdown appears at half-filling on the 2x2 lattice and extends to both half-filled and doped configurations on the 3x3 lattice.

They predicted that quantum paths exhibit a universal Hausdorff dimension that transitions from $d=2$ to $d=1$ as the momentum of the particle increases. However, although measurements were assumed to occur at intervals of time, the calculations only involved evaluating the expectation value of operators for the free evolution of wave function within a single interval, with no actual physical measurements performed. In this work we investigate how quantum measurements alter the fractal geometry of quantum particle paths. By modelling sequential measurements using Gaussian wave packets for both the particle and the apparatus, we reveal that the dynamics of the measurement change the roughness of the path and shift the emergent Hausdorff dimension towards a lower value in nonselective evolution. For selective evolution, feedback control forces must be introduced to counteract stochastic wave function collapse, stabilising trajectories and enabling dimensionality to be tuned. When the contribution of the measurement approaches zero, our result reduces to that of Abbott et al. Our work can thus be regarded as a more realistic formulation of their approach, and it connects theoretical quantum fractality with measurement physics, quantifying how detectors reshape spacetime statistics at quantum scales."}

Remarkably, in the case of $N, m \\in \\text{odd}$, these long-range entangled features persist even in the presence of a finite transverse field, demonstrating their robustness against quantum fluctuations. These results demonstrate how the interplay between system size and interaction range governs the emergence of long-range entanglement in one-dimensional spin systems."}

While the quantum Kibble-Zurek (QKZ) mechanism predicts universal scaling during quenches across a critical point, real quantum systems exhibit complex decoherence that can substantially modify these behaviors, ranging from altering critical scaling to completely suppressing it. By considering a specific case of nondemolishing noise, we first show how decoherence can reshape universal scaling and verify these theoretical predictions using numerical simulations of spin chains across a wide range of noise strengths. Then, we study linear quenches in the transverse-field Ising model on IBM superconducting processors where the noise model is unknown. Using large system sizes of 80-120 qubits, we measure equal-time connected correlations, defect densities, and excess energies across various quench times. Surprisingly, unlike earlier observations where noise-induced defect production masked universal behavior at long times, we observe clear scaling relations, pointing towards persistent universal structure shaped by decoherence. The extracted scaling exponents differ from both ideal QKZ predictions and analytic results for simplified noise models, suggesting the emergence of a distinct noise-influenced universality regime. Our results, therefore, point toward the possibility of using universal dynamical scaling as a high-level descriptor of quantum hardware, complementary to conventional gate-level performance metrics."}

To show the utility of this setup, we demonstrate the generation of displaced higher photon states with unit fidelity and the family of Schrodinger cat states above $98\\%$ fidelity.

Although a quantum-assisted hierarchical fuzzy neural network (QA-HFNN) was proposed to learn fuzzy membership for each feature, it cannot model dependencies between features due to its single-qubit encoding. To address this, this paper proposes a dual-qubit hierarchical fuzzy neural network (DQ-HFNN), encoding feature pairs onto a pair of entangled qubits, which extends the single-feature fuzzy model to a joint fuzzy representation. By introducing quantum entanglement, the dual-qubit circuit can encode non-classical correlations, enabling the model to directly learn relationship patterns between feature pairs. Experiments on benchmarks show that DQ-HFNN demonstrates higher classification accuracy than QA-HFNN, as well as classical deep learning baselines. Furthermore, ablation studies after controlling for circuit depth and parameter counts show that the performance gain mainly stems from the relational modeling capability enabled by entanglement rather than enhanced expressivity. The proposed DQ-HFNN model exhibits high parameter efficiency and fast inference speed. Experiments under noisy conditions suggest that it is robust against noise and has the potential to be implemented on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices."}

Our study reveals the essential contribution of coherent feedback in the thermal bath's input-noise operators, resulting in the system being driven far from thermal equilibrium.

The relationship between available entanglement and the sharing capacity remains largely unexplored, which constrains the efficient design and scalability of quantum networks. Here, we establish the entanglement threshold required to support unbounded sharing across an entire network by introducing a protocol based on probabilistic projective measurements. When resources fall below this threshold, we derive an achievable trade-off between the number of sharable branches and sharing rounds. To assess practical feasibility, we compare the detectability of our protocol with weak-measurement schemes and extend the sharing protocol to realistic noise models, providing a robust framework for nonlocality recycling in quantum networks."}

Here, we present a framework for a generic, two-stroke quantum heat engine interacting with $N$ thermal baths and Maxwell's demon. The demon performs projective measurements on the engine working substance, the outcome of which is recorded in a classical memory, embedded in its own thermal bath. To perform feedback control, the demon enacts unitary operations on the working substance, conditioned on the recorded outcome. By considering the compound machine-memory as a hybrid (classical-quantum) standard thermal machine interacting with $N+1$ thermal baths, our framework puts the working substance and memory on equal footing, thereby enabling a comprehensible resolution to Maxwell's paradox. We illustrate the application of our framework with a two-qubit engine. A remarkable observation is that more information does not necessarily result in better thermodynamic performance: sometimes knowing less is better."}

However, in the context of controlling ``chaotic'' quantum unitary dynamics, the situation is far more tenuous. The classical concepts of exponential sensitivity to trajectory initial conditions and ergodicity do not directly translate into quantum unitary evolution. Nevertheless properties inherent to quantum chaos can take on those roles: i) the dynamical sensitivity to weak perturbations, measured by the fidelity decay, serves a similar purpose as the classical sensitivity to initial conditions; and ii) paired with the fact that quantum chaotic systems are conjectured to be statistically described by random matrix theory, implies a method to translate the ergodic feature into the control of quantum dynamics. With those two properties, it can be argued that quantum chaotic dynamical systems, in principle, allow for full controllability beyond a characteristic time that scales only logarithmically with system size and $\\hbar^{-1}$. In the spirit of classical targeting, it implies that it is possible to fine tune the immense quantum interference with weak perturbations and steer the system from any initial state into any desired target state, subject to constraints imposed by conserved quantities. In contrast, integrable dynamics possess neither ergodicity nor exponential instability, and thus the weak perturbations apparently must break the integrability for control purposes. The main ideas are illustrated with the quantum kicked rotor. The production of revivals, cat-like entangled states, and the transition from any random state to any other random state is possible as demonstrated."}

In numerical experiments we study examples where we observe for a 1D Ising chain with nearest-neighbor interactions that the RGD steps needed to prepare a ground state scales linearly with the number of spins. For all-to-all couplings a quadratic scaling is obtained. To achieve efficient implementations while keeping convergence guarantees, we develop RGD approximations by randomly projecting the Riemannian gradient into polynomial-sized subspaces. We find that the speed of convergence of the randomly projected RGD critically depends on the size of the subspace the gradient is projected into.

Most previous studies have focused on the single-particle case in the far-field regime, where both approaches yield very similar arrival-time distributions and a semi-classical analysis typically suffices. Recent advances in atom-optics technologies now make it possible to experimentally investigate arrival-time distributions for entangled multi-particle systems in the near-field regime, where a deeper analysis beyond semi-classical approximations is required. Even in the far-field regime, due to quantum non-locality, the semi-classical approximation cannot generally hold in multi-particle systems. Therefore, in this work, two fundamental approaches to the arrival-time problem -- namely, the time-parameter and time-operator approaches -- are extended to multi-particle systems. Using these extensions, we propose a feasible two-particle arrival-time experiment and numerically evaluate the corresponding joint distributions. Our results reveal regimes in which the two approaches yield inequivalent predictions, highlighting conditions under which experiments could shed new light on distinguishing between competing accounts of time in quantum mechanics.

Second, we show that an exponential enhancement of the decay rate toward equilibrium, scaling with system size, can be obtained, leading to an extreme version of the phenomenon in Markovian open quantum systems. Third, we study the strong Mpemba effect through the unravelings of Davies maps, revealing subtleties in the choice of figures of merit used to identify the QME. Finally, we propose a microscopic model to gain deeper insight into bath dynamics in this context."}

Coherence between the internal states of a quantum emitter, or among multiple emitters, plays a key role. Such continuous nonclassical sources of light can find applications in quantum computation, quantum sensing, quantum metrology, and quantum communication.\n  This thesis explores the multi-photon lasing phenomena in various quantum dot-photonic crystal cavity quantum electrodynamic (QED) setups. Exciton-phonon interactions are inevitable in such systems and are incorporated using the polaron-transformed master equation. The Born-Markov approximation is employed to obtain the reduced density matrix rate equation. Using quantum laser theory, we derived the Scully-Lamb laser rate equations and evaluated the single- and multi-photon excess emission rates defined as the difference between emission and absorption rates into the cavity mode without mean-field approximations. We investigated cooperative two-photon lasing, correlated emission lasing, hyperradiant lasing, non-degenerate two-mode two-photon lasing, and continuous variable entanglement in open quantum systems with single or multiple semiconductor quantum dots (two-level, three-level, and four-level) driven coherently/incoherently and coupled to single/ bimodal cavities."}

For that purpose, dequantization algorithms play a central role in providing a clear theoretical framework to separate the complexity of quantum and classical algorithms. However, existing dequantized algorithms typically rely on sampling procedures, leading to prohibitively large computational overheads and hindering their practical implementation on classical computers. In this work, we propose a tensor network-based dequantization framework for GSEE that eliminates the sampling process while preserving the asymptotic complexity of prior dequantized algorithms. In our formulation, the overhead arising from sampling is replaced by the growth of the bond dimension required to represent Chebyshev vectors as tensor network states. Consequently, physical structure, such as entanglement and locality, is naturally reflected in the computational cost. By combining this approach with tensor network approximations, such as Matrix Product States (MPS), we construct a practical dequantization algorithm that is executable within realistic computational resources. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our method can efficiently construct high-degree polynomials up to $d=10^4$ for Hamiltonians with up to $100$ qubits, explicitly revealing the crossover between classically tractable and quantum advantaged regimes. These results indicate that tensor network-based dequantization provides a crucial tool toward the rigorous, quantitative verification of quantum advantage in realistic many-body systems."}

We provide a general formalism for $N$ qubits. For $N=2$ qubits, we classify normal and abnormal extremals, showcasing examples where abnormal solutions are either absent or suboptimal. For normal extremals, we establish a correspondence between the laser detuning from atomic transitions and the motion of a classical particle in a quartic potential, yielding a reduced, semi-analytic formulation of the control problem.

We explore three spin qubit systems in linear or triangular configurations. We derive analytical expressions for these multi-exchange entangling operations and demonstrate how to use the resulting three-qubit gates to construct quantum circuits capable of generating standard entangled states such as GHZ and W states, and the Toffoli gate, by optimizing control parameters.

Non-stochastic optimisation of the ternary tree class of encodings to date has targeted either the device or Hamiltonian. We develop a deterministic method which optimises ternary tree encodings without changing the underlying tree structure. This enables reduction in Pauli-weight without ancillae or additional swap-gate overhead. We demonstrate this method for a variety of encodings, including those which are derived from the qubit connectivity graph of a quantum computer.

We construct an exact solution to the time-dependent Schrodinger equation and by applying appropriate boundary conditions on the fermion fields we obtain a set of matrix difference equations called the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (qKZ) equations corresponding to the XXZ R-matrix. The consistency of these equations imposes constraints on the time-dependent interaction strengths $J_{\\parallel}(t)$ and $J_{\\perp}(t)$, such that the system is integrable. Remarkably, the resulting temporal trajectories of the couplings are shown to coincide exactly with the RG flow trajectories of the static Kondo model, establishing a direct and universal correspondence between integrability and renormalization-group flow in time-dependent quantum systems."}

The CE-ZK property allows a verifier of a quantum proof to revoke the proof in a way that can be checked (certified) by the prover. Conditioned on successful certification, the verifier's state can be efficiently simulated with only the statement, in a statistically indistinguishable way. Our contributions regarding these certified-everlasting NIZKs (CE-NIZKs) are as follows:\n  - We identify a barrier to obtaining CE-NIZKs in the CRS model via generalizations of known interactive proofs that satisfy CE-ZK.\n  - We circumvent this by constructing CE-NIZK from black-box use of NIZK for NP satisfying certain properties, along with OWFs. As a result, we obtain CE-NIZKs for NP in the CRS model, based on polynomial hardness of the learning with errors (LWE) assumption.\n  - In addition, we observe that the aforementioned barrier does not apply to the shared EPR model.

In this work, we explore the use of scrambling operations between parameter encoding to overcome sloppiness. We consider a bosonic model with two phase-shift parameters and analyze the performance of second- and third-order nonlinear scrambling using two classes of probe states: squeezed vacuum states and coherent states. Our results demonstrate that nonlinear scrambling mitigates sloppiness, increases compatibility, and improves overall estimation precision. We find third-order nonlinearity to be more effective than second-order under both fixed-probe and fixed-energy constraints. Furthermore, by comparing joint estimation to a stepwise estimation strategy, we show that a threshold for nonlinear coupling exists. For coherent probes, joint estimation outperforms the stepwise strategy if the nonlinearity is sufficiently large, while for squeezed probes, this advantage is observed specifically with third-order nonlinearity."}

We point out that the relevant mechanism is not intrinsically field-theoretic, but is essentially a quantum tunneling/evanescent matter channel, which is already captured within ordinary quantum mechanics. More importantly, the microscopic constituents of realistic macroscopic objects are bound and localized by strong potentials, introducing a large internal energy scale that suppresses coherent propagation between distant bodies. Including such binding/localization generically yields an exponential suppression, rendering the matter-mediated contribution negligible at the macroscopic separations relevant to gravitational-entanglement proposals. Consequently, the entanglement identified by AH diagnoses the presence of a coherent matter-exchange channel rather than the classical or quantum nature of gravity, and it does not undermine LOCC-based witness arguments in realistic bound-matter platforms."}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "We show that quantum oracles provide an advantage over classical oracles for answering classical counterfactual questions in causal models, or equivalently, for identifying unknown causal parameters such as distributions over functional dependences. In structural causal models with discrete classical variables, observational data and even ideal interventions generally fail to answer all counterfactual questions, since different causal parameters can reproduce the same observational and interventional data while disagreeing on counterfactuals. Using a simple binary example, we demonstrate that if the classical variables of interest are encoded in quantum systems and the causal dependence among them is encoded in a quantum oracle, coherently querying the oracle enables the identification of all causal parameters -- hence all classical counterfactuals. We generalize this to arbitrary finite cardinalities and prove that coherent probing 1) allows the identification of all two-way joint counterfactuals p(Y_x=y, Y_{x'}=y'), which is not possible with any number of queries to a classical oracle, and 2) provides tighter bounds on higher-order multi-way counterfactuals than with a classical oracle. This work can also be viewed as an extension to traditional quantum oracle problems such as Deutsch--Jozsa to identifying more causal parameters beyond just, e.g., whether a function is constant or balanced. Finally, we raise the question of whether this quantum advantage relies on uniquely non-classical features like contextuality. We provide some evidence against this by showing that in the binary case, oracles in some classically-explainable theories like Spekkens' toy theory also give rise to a counterfactual identifiability advantage over strictly classical oracles."}

Through dimensional reduction, the robust bulk band topology of, e.g., the integer quantum Hall system can be mapped onto similarly robust charge-pumping dynamics of a topological pump living in one lower dimension. Recent studies have uncovered a rich influence of interactions on the dynamics of topological pumps in nonlinear systems, including the robust pumping of self-bound solitons. These striking observations in classical nonlinear photonics have raised a number of questions, chiefly if and how this phenomenology persists in strongly correlated quantum systems and in the few-body limit. Here, using few- and many-atom arrays, we explore how dipolar interactions impact the dynamics of topological population pumping along a Rydberg synthetic dimension. In the few-body limit, we find that dipolar interactions lead to self-bound states that are efficiently pumped along the synthetic dimension, described by an emergent pair-state topological pump. We find that this interaction-assisted pumping persists in many-atom arrays, with a sharpened dependence on the dipolar interaction strength that stems from the enhanced spatial connectivity. These Rydberg-based studies on interaction-assisted topological pumping help connect observations from classical nonlinear photonics to the few-body quantum limit and pave the way for studies of new strongly correlated quantum pumping phenomena."}
