The first one is dedicated to\natomic-structure calculations with neutral and trivalent lanthanides, in the\ncontexts of ultracold gases and rare-earth doped solids. The second part deals\nwith long-range interactions in ultracold gases of alkali-metal atoms and\ndiatomic molecules, as well as lanthanide atoms. The detailed description of\nlong-range interactions serves to characterize ultralow-temperature phenomena,\nlike photoassociation and collisional shielding."}

For\nspecific potential and nonlinearity parameters, we derive analytically exact,\ndegenerate scattering states (doubly or triply degenerate) exhibiting perfect\ntransmission. Using the Bogoliubov--de Gennes approach, we analyze the\nstability of these reflectionless degenerate states, demonstrating that only\none solution within each degenerate manifold is dynamically stable.\nFurthermore, we study a configuration with spatially localized nonlinearity,\nidentifying an exact reflectionless state under specific conditions. Numerical\nanalysis shows that this state marks the system's transition from monostability\nto bistability as the incident wave amplitude increases. Our work establishes\nan analytic framework for these multistable transmission phenomena, directly\nrelevant to coherent matter-wave transport in ultracold atomic systems and\noptical propagation in engineered photonic lattices."}
