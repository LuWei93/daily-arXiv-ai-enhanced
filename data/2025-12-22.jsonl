However, these gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE) experiments rely on assumptions about subsystem independence. We sharpen the theoretical underpinnings of such proposals by examining them through the lens of algebraic quantum field theory (AQFT), distinguishing distinct operational and algebraic notions of independence. We argue that state and measurement independence of subsystems, essential to the experimental logic, is nontrivial in the presence of gauge constraints and gravitational dressing. Using gravitationally dressed fields, we recall that commutation relations between spacelike separated observables are nontrivial, undermining strict Hilbert space factorization. We further explore the implications for entanglement witnesses, investigating the Tsirelson bound when subsystem algebras fail to commute, and showing that the Tsirelson bound persists for a suitably symmetrized CHSH observable even though the operational status of such \"joint\" observables becomes delicate when commensurability fails. Our analysis highlights how even within linearized covariant quantum gravity, violations of microcausality may affect both the interpretation, modelling, and design of proposed laboratory tests of quantum gravity, despite remaining negligible for current experimental regimes. Although we consider GIE-style protocols as a concrete case study, the subsystem-independence issues we highlight are generic to low-energy (perturbative) quantum gravity. Finally, we derive estimates for dressing-induced microcausality violations, which suggest a complementary avenue to current proposals: in principle, bounding dressing-induced microcausality violations themselves as a probe of the quantum nature of gravity."}

Squeezed light has also played a pivotal role in quantum information science with numerous applications in quantum computing and communication. Previously, squeezed light has been primarily generated using nonlinear optical interactions, where control of the degree of squeezing was possible by tuning the nonlinearity of the generating medium using suitable material engineering. Here, we modulate the third-order nonlinear response in dielectrics with strong ultrafast laser fields to control the degree of squeezing on attosecond time scales. We demonstrate the ability to change the ultrafast squeezed light generated in the nonlinear process from amplitude-squeezed to phase-squeezed by controlling the strong-field-driven nonlinear response of the material through a sub-cycle phase delay between the input femtosecond laser pulses. The squeezing of quantum noise is measured using a frequency-resolved balanced homodyne detection scheme capable of extracting the field quadratures in different frequency modes simultaneously. Using this frequency-resolved measurement we extract the complete coherency matrix containing the quantum correlations between field quadratures across different frequency modes of the femtosecond squeezed light pulse. These results have major implications for the development of quantum light sources with unprecedented levels of control over quadrature squeezing, for applications in multimode quantum information processing, and for measuring transient quantum matter correlations via transduction to quantum field correlations in an ultrafast light-matter interaction."}

The scattering matrix zeros of the system correspond to a set of complex frequencies with exponentially rising waveforms, each of which can be virtually and perfectly absorbed. Thus, an arbitrary waveform, decomposed into these complex frequencies automatically, can be captured without any absorption. Then, in a well-designed coupled cavity system, various waveforms such as exponentially decaying, Gaussian, rectangular, and triangular profiles, are captured with high efficiency.

This theory integrates the optoelectronic imaging hardware front end and computational reconstruction back end into a unified framework. It establishes a complete spatial imaging chain information transfer model with the objective of obtaining the required effective information. The paper innovatively proposes a quantifiable Modulation Transfer Function (MTF)-Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) product criterion. It demonstrates that the system information transmission ability is determined by the product of MTF and SNR, and that these parameters can compensate for each other to achieve equivalent information transfer. Validation through a high-resolution Earth observation system case shows that under consistent reconstruction mean square error conditions, increasing time delay integration stages reduces optical aperture size and significantly lowers primary mirror mass. Simulations and physical experiments further indicate that by increasing integration time, low-resolution optical systems achieve reconstructed fidelity comparable to high-resolution systems. This verifies that small-aperture optical systems can achieve equivalent imaging performance by enhancing SNR. This theory has been successfully applied in the design of the Jilin-1 satellite constellation, providing a new paradigm for low-cost high-resolution remote sensing systems."}

Within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) framework, we develop a transfer-matrix method to compute reflection and transmission coefficients for incident phonons and free particles. Our results reveal a scattering threshold at the Zeeman energy $E = \\hbarΩ_0$, separating a pure phonon regime from multi-channel scattering involving both collective and single-particle excitations above threshold. For large twist angles, competition between kinetic and Zeeman energies reduces the effective spin rotation, leading to comb-like density modulations and Fano-like resonances below threshold. The transition probability between phonon and particle channels is strongly tunable with $Θ$, enhanced for odd multiples of $π$ but suppressed for even multiples. These findings establish twist-engineered domain walls as a versatile platform for controlling quantum transport, with implications for atomtronic devices and quantum simulation."}

In the special case of a perfect magnetic conductor interface, the first two terms vanish, so the residual Norton wave determines the steepest achievable field decay profile of $~r^{-3/2}$ (for a two-dimensional horizontal magnetic dipole). In this letter, we reveal that in the presence of a nonlocal metasurface described by the second-order impedance boundary condition, the field decay can be further accelerated by suppressing the Norton wave (approaching the profiles $r^{-5/2}$ and $r^{-7/2}$ for electric and magnetic fields, respectively).

The desired spatially inhomogeneous cavity-mediated couplings can be engineered in a 2D optical lattice using incommensurate cavity-lattice wavelengths naturally occurring in cavity QED systems. This minimal and fully tunable platform enables controlled state preparation and continuous measurement of superconducting order parameters, revealing phases in both equilibrium and sudden-quench settings with a single dominant pairing channel, as well as coexistence regimes with competing pairing channels.

Traditionally, spectrometers have been calibrated using reference gas cells or reference lamps. However, such conventional methods are not enough to meet the demands for high accuracy and stability. Although frequency-stabilized lasers offer excellent frequency uncertainty, they provide only a single calibration point at a fixed frequency, which is unsuitable for wide-range spectrometer calibration. In this work, we demonstrate a fully stabilized, high-repetition rate electro-optic frequency comb (EO comb) as an absolute frequency reference providing multiple calibration points over a broad spectral range. Our 25 GHz EO comb provides a broadband spectrum spanning from 189.5 THz to 196 THz (corresponding to 1530 nm to 1582 nm), traceable to a frequency standard with a relative standard uncertainty of 10^-13. The well-defined and evenly spaced comb modes can be spectrally resolved by conventional optical spectrometers, enabling wide-range, high-precision frequency calibration. We directly calibrated a commercial spectrometer by referencing its measured frequency values to our well-defined comb modes, thereby evaluating the frequency error with a standard uncertainty of 20 MHz (or relative standard uncertainty of 10^-7), which is limited by the Type A uncertainty (repeatability) of the spectrometer. The proposed method is simple to implement and provides multiple calibration points referenced to the frequency standards over a broad spectral range. This approach improves both the calibration and performance evaluation of spectrometers, and it contributes to the advancement of optical metrology."}

In particular, increasing attention has been devoted to the emergence of non-equilibrium universality classes that have no equilibrium counterparts. A prominent example is the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class realized in dissipative Bose-Einstein condensates. In this Letter, motivated by recent experimental advances, we investigate the universal dynamics of dissipative quantum systems with dipole moment conservation. We develop an effective field theory description, supported by a concrete quantum spin model, to capture the resulting universal behaviors. Our analysis unveils a novel strongly interacting non-equilibrium fixed point that governs the equal-time phase fluctuations in systems with either strong or weak dipole symmetries. Moreover, charge transport becomes subdiffusive in the presence of strong dipole symmetry, while it remains diffusive in the weakly symmetric case. Our results reveal the intricate interplay between kinetic constraints and dissipation in quantum many-body systems."}

Achieving this control requires both enhanced local electromagnetic fields to boost emission intensity and engineered radiation patterns to direct photons efficiently. Mie voids, consisting of an air cavity surrounded by a high-index semiconductor, are particularly suited for this purpose because they expose their strongest fields in an accessible region for nearby emitters while supporting resonances that shape directional emission through interference. Here, we demonstrate an all-van der Waals nanophotonic platform that couples excitons in atomically thin WS$_2$ to Mie void resonators formed in WSe$_2$. Guided by electromagnetic simulations, we identify void geometries that maximize photoluminescence through synergistic enhancement of excitation and emission processes. We also develop a two-step fabrication strategy that enables independent control of void diameter and depth, providing a route to systematically tune the optical response. Experimentally, we observe up to a 600-fold increase in photoluminescence intensity from monolayer WS$_2$ placed on individual voids compared to on an unstructured WSe$_2$, along with pronounced out-of-plane beaming of light that yields a forward-to-off-axis enhancement of 2.6 dB.

Here, the key challenge is to separate the small quantum vacuum signal at the oscillation frequency of the probe that is mainly emitted in the vicinity of its forward cone from the large probe background. While quantitatively accurate predictions of the associated quantum vacuum signals are available, to date there is no framework that combines these predictions with a diffractive beam propagation code. Such codes are designed to holistically model optical experiments and can reliably account for diffraction and absorption losses of optical devices, like lenses and apertures. The latter inevitably influence and modify both the induced signal and background components prior to their detection in experiment.

In a different direction, the Kaluza-Klein proposal aims to recover gauge symmetries by means of dimensional reduction of higher-dimensional gravitational theories. Integrating both, gravitational and gauge degrees of freedom in $3+1$ dimensions may be obtained upon dimensional reduction of higher-dimensional emergent gravity. To this end, we show that entangled systems of two and three qubits can be associated with $5+1$ and $9+1$ dimensional spacetimes respectively, which are reduced to $3+1$ dimensions upon singling out a preferred complex direction. In the latter case, this reduction is invariant under a residual $SU(3) \\times SU(2) \\times U(1) /\\mathbb{Z}_6$ symmetry, the Standard Model gauge group. This motivates a picture in which spacetime emerges from the area law-contribution to the entanglement entropy, while gauge and matter degrees of freedom are due to area law-violating terms.

Furthermore, we highlight the possibility of using this construction in quantum simulations of Standard Model fields."}

However, its acquisition speed remains limited by fluorophore emission rates and photodamage. To increase the pixel rate of a two-photon microscope beyond a few megahertz (MHz), multi-point parallelized schemes have been proposed. Two-photon (2P) light-sheet microscopy emerges as an effective approach for high-speed multiphoton imaging of live specimens, as it enables parallelized excitation while minimizing the required laser power. However, optimizing the signal-to-photodamage ratio in 2P light-sheet microscopy requires to precisely control the illumination parameters, including both wavelength and pulse frequency. Since conventional femtosecond laser sources generally do not allow independent modulation of these parameters, the development of low-cost, efficient and robust strategies to modulate the temporal excitation profile is essential to fully exploit the advantages of 2P light-sheet microscopy. Here, we introduce a compact pulse splitting scheme that meets these criteria. We used cascaded birefringent crystals to convert each excitation laser pulse into an adjustable sequence of collinear sub-pulses. We demonstrate its effectiveness in optimizing 2P light-sheet imaging of live zebrafish embryos. We analyze the impact of pulse splitting on photobleaching, nonlinear photodamage, and imaging performance. Additionally, we demonstrate high-speed 2P imaging of the beating heart and brain calcium dynamics using red fluorophores in live embryos. We achieve kilohertz imaging frame rate, reaching more than 150 MHz pixel rates with fluorescent signal levels above 10 $photons.pixel^{-1}$ using a laser mean power and a peak intensity in the range of 100 mW and 0.1 $TW.cm^{-2}$ at the sample, respectively.

We show that for exact-weight bias classes, the induced single-query ensemble state on the address register has a two-eigenspace structure that yields closed-form expressions for the single-copy Helstrom-optimal measurement and success probability. Because complementing $f$ changes the state $|ψ\\rangle$ only by a global phase, hypotheses $p$ and $1-p$ are information-theoretically identical in this model; thus the natural discriminand is the phase-bias magnitude $|μ|$ (equivalently $μ^2$).

Squeezed light has also played a pivotal role in quantum information science with numerous applications in quantum computing and communication. Previously, squeezed light has been primarily generated using nonlinear optical interactions, where control of the degree of squeezing was possible by tuning the nonlinearity of the generating medium using suitable material engineering. Here, we modulate the third-order nonlinear response in dielectrics with strong ultrafast laser fields to control the degree of squeezing on attosecond time scales. We demonstrate the ability to change the ultrafast squeezed light generated in the nonlinear process from amplitude-squeezed to phase-squeezed by controlling the strong-field-driven nonlinear response of the material through a sub-cycle phase delay between the input femtosecond laser pulses. The squeezing of quantum noise is measured using a frequency-resolved balanced homodyne detection scheme capable of extracting the field quadratures in different frequency modes simultaneously. Using this frequency-resolved measurement we extract the complete coherency matrix containing the quantum correlations between field quadratures across different frequency modes of the femtosecond squeezed light pulse. These results have major implications for the development of quantum light sources with unprecedented levels of control over quadrature squeezing, for applications in multimode quantum information processing, and for measuring transient quantum matter correlations via transduction to quantum field correlations in an ultrafast light-matter interaction."}

To this end, equations of motion for Bloch components are derived from the von Neumann equation, which are mathematically equivalent to equations of motion for a distribution of point masses from classical mechanics. Furthermore, using the Heisenberg equation, another system of Bloch vector equations is derived, which forms an Euler-Poinsot system, as is commonly encountered in the theory of torque-free spinning tops. This is used to prove the Liouville integrability of the corresponding Hamilton equations of motion, whereby formal connections to the Neumann model of classical Hamiltonian dynamics and the Hamiltonian Euler-Poinsot model are drawn to identify the first integrals of motion. Within the same framework, stability criteria for quantum dynamics are then derived which correspond to the Routh-Hurwitz criterion resp. other criteria following from the Energy-Casimir method of classical Newtonian mechanics. Following that, specific solutions to the equations of motion are constructed that encode the complex dynamics of composite quantum systems. Eventually, to show that this formalism provides concrete physical predictions, an analogue of the intermediate axis theorem is derived and the effect of oscillating entanglement is discussed. As a basis for this, special types of solutions to the equations of motion are derived that constitute oscillating entangled states, i.e., dynamical quantum states that change their entanglement structure from maximally entangled to separable and vice versa."}

This regularity constraint yields a hierarchy: sectoral solutions ($ν= μ$, satisfying the first-order highest-weight condition) exist for any real $μ> 0$, while tesseral and zonal solutions require integer steps, appearing only when $μ$ itself is integer. Third, application to a Coulomb potential shows that the familiar integer angular momentum spectrum of hydrogen arises from the periodic identification $φ\\sim φ+ 2π$ that defines the full-sphere Hilbert space domain; modified boundary conditions yield a reorganised spectrum with non-integer effective angular momentum.

This paper proposes the concept of frequency-multiplexed millimeter-wave superconducting qubits and demonstrates a novel architecture that integrates an on-chip cryogenic nonreciprocal space-time-periodic superconducting frequency multiplier as a universal control bus for a frequency-multiplexed qubit array. The bus replaces multiple high-frequency XY drive lines with a single low-frequency input tone, which the multiplier converts into a comb of high-order harmonics, each resonantly addressing a distinct qubit. Crucially, the dynamic and nonreciprocal nature of the bus provides signal gain and intrinsic isolation that simultaneously suppresses Purcell decay, enhancing T1 times across all distinct-frequency qubits, and reduces coherent crosstalk by more than two orders of magnitude. The spatiotemporal modulation enables parametric frequency multiplication and creates wave-propagation dynamics analogous to cosmological expansion, with observed redshift-like broadening and deceleration of magnetic-field wavepackets. Theoretical modeling based on a non-Markovian master equation confirms that the engineered memory kernel extends coherence while reshaping the noise spectrum. Full error-budget analysis shows that the architecture maintains gate errors below the fault-tolerance threshold for arrays exceeding 25 qubits, converting a crosstalk-dominated error budget into one limited by intrinsic material coherence. This integrated, frequency-multiplexed, and nonreciprocal control bus therefore offers a path toward unprecedented I/O simplification, noise resilience, and scalable high-coherence quantum processin"}

Using an SU(3) representation of a Grover type coin together with a Lindblad formulation of decoherence acting either on the coin or the spatial subspace, we systematically expand the discrete dynamics in both space and time to obtain continuum master equations governing the coarse grained evolution. The resulting generators yield a genuine partial differential equation description of the walk, going beyond purely probabilistic or spectral correspondences. We show that the unitary limit is governed by a Dirac-type SU(3) Hamiltonian describing ballistic advection of left and right moving modes coupled by local symmetric mixing, with the rest state acting as an additional internal degree of freedom. Coin dephasing selectively damps internal coherences while preserving coherent spatial transport, whereas spatial dephasing suppresses long range spatial interference and rapidly drives the dynamics toward classical behaviour. This continuum framework clarifies how internal symmetry, rest state coupling, and distinct decoherence channels shape large scale transport in lazy open quantum walks, and provides a foundation for future extensions toward multichannel quantum transport models and quantum-inspired algorithms."}

We consider a one-dimensional mixed-field Ising model, as well as a chain of Rydberg atoms, and compare numerical calculations and experimental results for the end-to-end transfer error with different schedule functions. We show, in particular, that if the time dependent Hamiltonian is $n$ times differentiable with vanishing $1^{st}$ to $n^{th}$ order derivatives in the beginning and in the end, the infidelity with respect to the final adiabatic eigenstate scales as $1/T^{n+1}$ when evolving for time $T$."}

Here, we demonstrate the deterministic generation of a bright non-Gaussian state by introducing a Kerr nonlinearity to a macroscopic state of light called bright squeezed vacuum (BSV). To characterize the resulting state, we use a single-shot f-2f interferometer to sample its Husimi function. We observe a clear transformation from a 2D Gaussian distribution to an 'S'-shaped non-Gaussian profile, which is the direct statistical evidence of the intensity-dependent nonlinear phase. The negativity of the Wigner function, which is an intrinsic property of any pure non-Gaussian state, cannot be observed because BSV is a mixed state even under minute optical loss. However, we show that BSV can be considered as a mixture of pure squeezed coherent states, for some of which Kerr-induced Wigner-function negativity is quite tolerant to loss. This work bridges the gap between quantum optics and ultrafast nonlinear optics, opening a path to quantum applications that require high photon flux."}

We present a Domain-Aware Quantum Circuit (DAQC) that leverages image priors to guide locality-preserving encoding and entanglement via non-overlapping DCT-style zigzag windows. The design employs interleaved encode-entangle-train cycles, where entanglement is applied among qubits hosting neighboring pixels, aligned to device connectivity. This staged, locality-preserving information flow expands the effective receptive field without deep global mixing, enabling efficient use of limited depth and qubits. The design concentrates representational capacity on short-range correlations, reduces long-range two-qubit operations, and encourages stable optimization, thereby mitigating depth-induced and globally entangled barren-plateau effects. We evaluate DAQC on MNIST, FashionMNIST, and PneumoniaMNIST datasets. On quantum hardware, DAQC achieves performance competitive with strong classical baselines (e.g., ResNet-18/50, DenseNet-121, EfficientNet-B0) and substantially outperforming Quantum Circuit Search (QCS) baselines. To the best of our knowledge, DAQC, which uses a quantum feature extractor with only a linear classical readout (no deep classical backbone), currently achieves the best reported performance on real quantum hardware for QML-based image classification tasks.

Quantum optimal transport, and the quantum Wasserstein distance as the minimal cost associated with transforming one quantum state to another, is expected to have implications in quantum state discrimination and quantum metrology. In this work, following the formalism introduced in [De Palma, G. and Trevisan, D. Ann. Henri Poincaré, {\\bf 22} (2021), 3199-3234] to compute the optimal transport plan between two quantum states, we give a general formula for the Wasserstein distance of order 2 between any two one-mode Gaussian states. We discuss how the Wasserstein distance between classical Gaussian distributions and the quantum Wasserstein distance by De Palma and Trevisan for thermal states can be recovered from our general formula for Gaussian states. This opens the path to directly compare various known distance measures with the Wasserstein distance through their closed-form solutions."}

The witness also quantifies the magnitude of ODLRO within each particle type, revealing how fermionic and bosonic correlations combine to form the total entanglement of the system, including a bosonic condensation of particle-hole pairs driven by many-body correlations rather than particle statistics. Using the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick spin model, we show how the transition from ODLRO localized to one particle type to ODLRO shared by both particle types captures the onset of collective entanglement in a mixed-particle environment, providing new insight into systems where fermionic and bosonic correlations coexist."}

The desired spatially inhomogeneous cavity-mediated couplings can be engineered in a 2D optical lattice using incommensurate cavity-lattice wavelengths naturally occurring in cavity QED systems. This minimal and fully tunable platform enables controlled state preparation and continuous measurement of superconducting order parameters, revealing phases in both equilibrium and sudden-quench settings with a single dominant pairing channel, as well as coexistence regimes with competing pairing channels. Crucially, our implementation allows direct observation of topological transitions in and out of equilibrium, providing a powerful route to the quantum simulation of competing topological superconducting phases that remain elusive in solid-state and ultracold-atom systems."}

We use a fully solvable one-dimensional Ising model to show that local basis rotations leave the loss landscape unchanged while relocating the exact wavefunction in parameter space, effectively increasing its geometric distance from typical initializations. By sweeping a rotation angle, we compute quantum Fisher information and Fubini-Study distances to quantify how the rotated wavefunction moves within the loss landscape. Shallow architectures (with focus on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs)) trained with quantum natural gradient are more likely to fall into saddle-point regions depending on the rotation angle: they achieve low energy error but fail to reproduce correct coefficient distributions. In the ferromagnetic case, near-degenerate eigenstates create high-curvature barriers that trap optimization at intermediate fidelities. We introduce a framework based on an analytically solvable rotated Ising model to investigate how relocating the target wavefunction within a fixed loss landscape exposes information-geometric barriers,such as saddle points and high-curvature regions,that hinder shallow NQS optimization, underscoring the need for landscape-aware model design in variational training."}

We present a new method to visualize how efficiently a practical measurement scheme captures the information available in the scattered light by mapping out the local contribution to the detection efficiency on the detector surface. We use this tool to experimentally optimize the free space measurement of the amplitude of motion of an optomechanical resonator with a quadrant photodiode. We show that blocking sections of the photodetector enhances sensitivity, counterintuitively yielding a significant improvement in detecting higher-order mechanical modes in the system. We also show how our method can be applied to light scattering measurements of small particles."}

Here, we numerically compute the momentum-space two-point correlation function in a quantum fluid using the truncated Wigner approximation, a general method applicable to both conservative and driven-dissipative systems.

This structure enables shot-noise-limited displacement sensing at ~15 pm precision using routinely available synchrotron fluxes and practical nanofabricated slit/comb geometries, requiring mechanical stability only over the final 0.5 mm. The same principle provides a foundation for future nanometer-resolution 3D X-ray microtomography of bulk samples, potentially resulting in a reduced radiation dose. Two conceptual strategies, a central blocker and off-axis multi-slit arrays, are estimated to lower the required incident fluence by more than one order of magnitude each, yielding combined reductions of two to three orders of magnitude with near-term detector development.
