By engineering temporal modulations at the interfaces of hyperbolic media, we achieve isolation between forward and backward beams while preserving the hallmark property of negative refraction. Two complementary approaches are developed: in the optical regime, a multilayer AZO/ZnO hyperbolic slab is sandwiched between permittivity-modulated dielectric layers (3D time crystals); in the microwave regime, a wire medium is sandwiched between time-modulated resistive metasurfaces (2D time crystals). Both designs exploit Floquet harmonic expansions and are validated with a customized harmonic-balance finite-element solver. We report isolation exceeding 46 dB in the optical device and ~11 dB in the microwave counterpart. This work introduces a general framework for nonreciprocal negative refraction across frequency regimes, expanding the design space of time-varying metasurfaces and photonic time crystals."}

Recent breakthroughs in strong-coupling electro-optic modulation further expanded their accessible nonlinear dynamics, unlocking new phenomena and functionalities, but the underlying foundation remains largely unexplored. Here we establish a universal theoretical and experimental framework for nonlinear combs under arbitrary electro-optic modulation by introducing a general evolution equation (GEE) that transcends the mean-field Lugiato-Lefever equation. The GEE reduces to a discrete-time Integration Hamiltonian that provides a frequency-domain formalism unifying strong-coupling electro-optic modulation with photonic synthetic dimensions. Together with a band-wave correspondence linking modulation waveforms to synthetic band structures, the formalism enables programmable spectral control. We further show compatibility between Kerr nonlinearity and strong-coupling electro-optic modulation, highlighting their cooperative dynamics. Our work provides a foundational model for strong-coupling electro-optics in nonlinear combs, opening a route toward chip-integrated, microwave-programmable comb sources for metrology, spectroscopy, and emerging photonic technologies."}

Draft submitting for \"Optics and Lasers in Engineering.\"", "summary": "Wavefront reconstruction in lateral shearing interferometry typically assumes that the shear amount is an integer multiple of the sampling interval. When the shear is fractional, approximating it with the nearest integer value leads to noticeable reconstruction errors. To address this, we propose a weighted integer shear averaging method. The approach combines reconstructions from nearby integer shears with carefully chosen weights designed to cancel the dominant error terms. Analytical error analysis shows that two-shear averaging removes first-order errors, while three-shear averaging removes second-order errors. Numerical simulations with a test wavefront confirm that the method achieves significantly lower RMS error than conventional single-shear reconstruction. The technique is simple, computationally efficient, and can be readily extended to two-dimensional interferometry. This makes weighted integer shear averaging a practical and accurate tool for wavefront reconstruction when fractional shear is unavoidable."}

The artificial magnetic flux typically introduces Peierls phase factors, which induces complex-valued hopping amplitudes and leads to directed net particle currents along the chains. By further incorporating the finite inter-ring coupling and biased intra-ring hopping, we reveal that the tuning of the drive frequency and Peierls phase allows the precise control over both the intensity and direction of particle currents, which facilitates the transition between chiral and antichiral dynamics. These findings offer insights into the coherent manipulation of matter-wave transports in closed-loop lattice configurations and the exploration of nonequilibrium synthetic quantum systems in related fields."}

It is shown that, similar to the case of the passage of long-wavelength neutrons through a refractive sample, the accelerated motion of a crystal results in a change in neutron energy. The physical nature of the phenomenon in both cases is determined by the difference in the Doppler frequency shift at the entrance and exit of the wave through the sample. The difference between the case of ordinary refraction of long-wavelength neutrons and the case of wave passage through a crystal under conditions where diffraction has a dominant influence on the nature of wave propagation is only quantitative.

Dynamic and reconfigurable metalenses are key to next-generation flat-optics platforms, yet their practical realization remains limited by slow response, optical loss, and polarization sensitivity. The integration of chalcogenide phase-change materials with metasurface architectures offers a powerful platform for dynamic optical tunability, owing to materials such as Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ (GST) that can reversibly switch between amorphous and crystalline states with distinct refractive indices. However, the strong optical absorption of crystalline GST in the visible to near-infrared range has hindered its widespread use in reconfigurable metalenses. In this study, we design an all-dielectric polarization-insensitive metasurface based on hybrid Si--GST nanostructures to realize a dynamically tunable bifocal metalens operating at 1.55 μm. The device achieves a variable focal length from 70 μm to 200 μm, with focusing efficiencies of 30% in the amorphous state and 20% in the crystalline state, as validated through finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) simulations. Using COMSOL Multiphysics, we show that flat-top laser excitation enables uniform, reversible phase transitions within tens of nanoseconds -- amorphization in approximately 13~ns and crystallization in approximately 90~ns -- without mechanical motion or electrical bias. For next-generation metasurfaces intended for uses including beam steering, dynamic holography, optical routing, multi-depth imaging, and optical communication, this method shows great promise due to its control and stability."}

This represents an \"offline closed-loop, online open-loop\" feasibility demonstration. Using an Aer-based emulator calibrated with ibm_fez device parameters, Aurora-DD achieves substantial reductions in mean-squared error of the measured expectation value <Z>, yielding 68-97% improvement across phase settings phi = 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20 over n=30 randomized trials.

On real superconducting hardware (ibm_fez), we perform a small-sample (n=3) multi-phase validation campaign. Aurora-DD yields point estimates corresponding to approximately 99.2-99.6% reduction in absolute error relative to a no-DD baseline across all tested phase points. These hardware numbers are reported transparently as feasibility evidence under tight queue and credit constraints. In contrast, the auxiliary Aurora+ZNE branch exhibits instability: shallow two-point ZNE occasionally amplifies calibration inconsistencies and produces large error outliers. We therefore relegate ZNE analysis to the Appendix and position Aurora-DD (without ZNE) as the primary contribution.

Here, we report a low-dose deep-UV lensless holographic microscopy platform that uses standard board-level CMOS sensors designed for visible light, eliminating all imaging optics and dedicated DUV detectors. Our system achieves large field-of-view (up to 116 mm2) DUV imaging with low illumination and label-free phase and chemically specific amplitude contrast. A specialized defocus/wavelength diverse pixel super-resolution reconstruction with total-variation regularization and robust autofocusing halves the effective sensor pixel pitch and yields down to 870 nm lateral resolution. We demonstrate chemically specific, label-free bioimaging on challenging specimens, including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, extracellular vesicles and unstained mouse liver tissue. In liver sections, imaging at λ = 330 nm reveals lipid- and retinoid-rich accumulations that co-localize with Oil Red O staining, enabling label-free identification of hepatic stellate (Ito) cells.

For methods that characterize electromagnetic effects, these numerical methods are referred to as computational electromagnetics (CEM) methods. Although the CEM research field is mature, emerging applications can still stress the capabilities of the techniques in use today. The design of superconducting circuit quantum devices falls in this category due to the unconventional material properties and important features of the devices covering nanometer to centimeter scales. Such multiscale devices can stress the fundamental properties of CEM tools which can lead to an increase in simulation times, a loss in accuracy, or even cause no solution to be reliably found. While these challenges are being investigated by CEM researchers, knowledge about them is limited in the broader community of users of these CEM tools. This review is meant to serve as a practical introduction to the fundamental aspects of the major CEM techniques that a researcher may need to choose between to model a device, as well as provide insight into what steps they may take to alleviate some of their challenges. Our focus is on highlighting the main concepts without rigorously deriving all the details, which can be found in many textbooks and articles. After covering the fundamentals, we discuss more advanced topics related to the challenges of modeling multiscale devices with specific examples from superconducting circuit quantum devices. We conclude with a discussion on future research directions that will be valuable for improving the ability to successfully design increasingly more sophisticated superconducting circuit quantum devices. Although our focus and examples are taken from this area, researchers from other fields will still benefit from the details discussed here."}

The momentum-energy representation $φ(k,E)$ is treated merely as a Fourier re-expression of the same state-kinematically equivalent but dynamically inert.

Kernel-based procedures for hypothetical testing have been proposed to efficiently disentangle high-dimensional complex structures in data to obtain accurate results in a model-free way by embedding the data into the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). While the choice of kernels plays a crucial role for their performance, little is understood about how to choose kernel especially for small datasets. Here we aim to construct a hypothetical test which is effective even for small datasets, based on the theoretical foundation of kernel-based tests using maximum mean discrepancy, which is called MMD-FUSE. To address this, we enhance the MMD-FUSE framework by incorporating quantum kernels and propose a novel hybrid testing strategy that fuses classical and quantum kernels. This approach creates a powerful and adaptive test by combining the domain-specific inductive biases of classical kernels with the unique expressive power of quantum kernels. We evaluate our method on various synthetic and real-world clinical datasets, and our experiments reveal two key findings: 1) With appropriate hyperparameter tuning, MMD-FUSE with quantum kernels consistently improves test power over classical counterparts, especially for small and high-dimensional data. 2) The proposed hybrid framework demonstrates remarkable robustness, adapting to different data characteristics and achieving high test power across diverse scenarios. These results highlight the potential of quantum-inspired and hybrid kernel strategies to build more effective statistical tests, offering a versatile tool for data analysis where sample sizes are limited."}

This progress creates urgency for the development of compilation workflows that directly target the forthcoming generation of devices with thousands of physical qubits, for which algorithm execution becomes practical. We develop a pipeline for compiling logical algorithms to physical circuits implementing lattice surgery on the surface code, and use this pipeline to identify the requirements for achieving algorithmic break-even -- where quantum error correction improves the performance of a quantum algorithm -- for two prominent quantum algorithms: the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) and quantum phase estimation (QPE). Our pipeline integrates several open-source software tools, and leverages recent advances in error-aware unitary gate synthesis, high-fidelity magic state production, and the calculation of correlation surfaces in the surface code. We perform classical simulations of physical Clifford proxy circuits produced by our pipeline, and find that both 5-qubit QAOA and QPE can reach algorithmic break-even with 2517 physical qubits (surface code distance $d=11$) at physical error rates of $p=10^{-3}$, or 1737 physical qubits ($d=9$) at $p=5\\times 10^{-4}$.

A major challenge, however, lies in their inherently substantial sampling cost, primarily due to the individual measurement of each term in the Hamiltonian. While various techniques have been proposed to mitigate this issue, the sampling overhead remains a significant bottleneck, especially for practical large-scale electronic structure problems. In this work, we introduce an alternative method, dubbed mirror subspace diagonalization (MSD), which approaches the theoretical lower bound of the sampling cost for quantum Krylov algorithms. MSD leverages a finite-difference formula to express the Hamiltonian operator as a linear combination of time-evolution unitaries with symmetrically shifted timesteps, enabling efficient estimation of the Hamiltonian matrix within the Krylov subspace. In this scheme, the finite difference and statistical errors are simultaneously minimized by optimizing the timestep parameter and shifting the energy spectrum. Consequently, MSD attains the lower bound of the sampling cost of the quantum Krylov algorithms up to a logarithmic factor. Furthermore, we employ classical post-processing to infer Hamiltonian moments, which are used to mitigate the ground state energy error based on the Lanczos scheme. Through theoretical analysis of the sampling cost, we demonstrate that MSD is particularly effective when the spectral norm of the Hamiltonian is significantly smaller than its 1-norm. Such a situation arises, for example, in high-accuracy simulations of molecules using large basis sets that incorporate strong electronic correlations. Numerical results for various molecular models reveal that MSD can achieve sampling cost reductions ranging from approximately 10 to 10,000 times compared to the conventional quantum Krylov algorithm."}

Our system consists of two mechanically coupled mechanical resonators, which are driven by a common electromagnetic field. An inclusion of a polarizer induces linear polarizations of the electromgnetic field corresponding to the vertical (transverse electric ($\\rm{TE}$) and horizontal (transverse magnetic [($\\rm{TM}$]) modes, which drive the mechanical resonators. Without the mechanical coupling $J_m=0$, the polarization angle ($φ$) controls dark mode in the system. The breaking of this dark mode leads to multi-paths engineering of bipartite optomechanical entanglements. By switching on the phonon hopping rate ($J_m\\neq0$), both the polarization angle and the modulation phase of the mechanical coupling allow a further control of the dark mode. The simultaneous Dark Mode Breaking (\\rm{DMB}) conditions under these two parameters leads to multi-paths bipartite and tripartite entanglements. For a fine tuning of the polarization angle ($φ=π/4$) this scheme enables a generation of twin entangled states, where the bipartite/tripartite generated entangled states are degenerated and might be of great interest for quantum information processing, quantum communication and diverse quantum computational tasks. The generated entanglements are more resilient against thermal fluctuations in the \\rm{DMB} regime, i.e., up to two order of magnitude robust than in the Unbreaking regime.

This yields closed-form expressions for $F$ and $D$ in arbitrary Hilbert-space dimension and delivers tight bounds that link the admissible deviation directly to the gap from the optimal average performance. In particular, any measured pair $(F, D)$ can be ported into a visibility estimate for isotropic channel resources, turning the $(F, D)$-plane into a calibrated diagnostic map.

At the same time, this local description naturally invites a set of complementary, more global questions about the structure of the space of pure states: How abundant are the states with a given amount of entanglement within the full state space? Do the manifolds of constant entanglement exhibit distinct geometric regimes? These questions shift the focus from assigning an entanglement value to a single state to understanding the global organization and geometry of entanglement across the entire manifold of pure states.\n  In this work, we develop a geometric framework in which these questions become natural. We regard the projective Hilbert space of pure states, endowed with the Fubini-Study metric, as a Riemannian manifold and promote bipartite entanglement to a macroscopic functional on this manifold. Its level sets stratify the space of pure states into hypersurfaces of constant entanglement, and we define a geometric entanglement entropy as the log-volume of these hypersurfaces, weighted by the Fubini-Study gradient of entanglement. This quantity plays the role of a microcanonical entropy in entanglement space: it measures the degeneracy of a given entanglement value in the natural quantum geometry.\n  The framework is illustrated first in the simplest case of a single spin-1/2 and then for bipartite entanglement of spin systems, including a two-qubit example where explicit calculations can be carried out, along with a sketch of the extension to spin chains."}

Building on the classical framework (Aumann, 1976), we define the modality of \"common certainty\" through a hierarchy of certainty operators acting on each agent's Hilbert space. In the commuting case -- when all measurements and event projectors commute -- common certainty leads to equality of the agents' conditional probabilities, recovering a QM analog of the classical theorem. By contrast, when non-commuting operators are allowed, the certainty recursion can stabilize with different probabilities. This yields common certainty of disagreement (CCD) as a distinctive QM phenomenon. Agreement is restored once measurement outcomes are recorded in a classical register. The classical Agreement Theorem can therefore be seen as emergent from the quantum world via recording. We establish an impossibility result stating that QM forbids a scenario where one agent is certain that a property of interest occurs, and is also certain that the other agent is certain that the property does not occur. In this sense, QM admits non-classical disagreement, but disagreement is still bounded in a disciplined way. We argue that our analysis offers a rigorous approach to the longstanding issue of how to understand intersubjectivity across agents in QM."}

By introducing power law couplings that algebraically decay with the distance between the spins $r$ as $1/r^α$, we break this symmetry with a non-zero $α$, and probe the emergence of new dynamical behaviors, including thermalization. As we increase $α$, the system interpolates from an infinite range spin system at $α=0$ exhibiting permutation symmetry, to a short range integrable model as $α\\rightarrow \\infty$ where this permutation symmetry is absent. We focus on the change in the behavior of the system as $α$ is tuned, using dynamical quantities like total angular momentum operator $J^2$ and the von Neumann entropy $S_{N/2}$. Starting from the chaotic limit of the permutation symmetric Hamiltonian at $α=0$, we find that for small $α$, the steady state values of these quantities remain close to the permutation symmetric subspace values corresponding to $α=0$. At intermediate $α$ values, these show signatures of thermalization exhibiting values corresponding to that of random states in full Hilbert space. On the other hand, the large $α$ limit approaches the values corresponding to integrable kicked Ising model. In addition, we also study the dependence of thermalization on the driving period $τ$, with results indicating the onset of thermalization for smaller values of $α$ when $τ$ is large, thereby extending the intermediate range of $α$.

In this study, we analyze the quantum properties of the entangled final states generated in the QGEM scheme. Our findings reveal that the photon emission rates (transition rates) are closely related to the degree of entanglement.

In this work, we investigate the stability of the superradiant phase in the presence of a weak spin relaxation. We find that even a weak spin relaxation can render the superradiant phase to a superradiant metastable phase, in which symmetry-breaking states are stable only for a finite time. This arises because each spin-jump induced by relaxation applies as a strong perturbation to the system, potentially driving the system from a symmetry-breaking state to the symmetry-preserving saddle point with finite probability, before it eventually relaxes back to a symmetry-breaking state. Such dynamical processes lead to a finite lifetime of the symmetry-breaking states and restore the symmetry in the steady state. To substantiate these results, we combine mean-field and cumulant expansion analyses with exact numerical simulations. The lifetime of the symmetry-breaking states are analyzed in finite-size systems, and the conclusions are extrapolated to the thermodynamic limit via finite-size scaling. Our findings establish the metastable nature of the symmetry-breaking states in the dissipative quantum Rabi model and reveal the complexity of the dissipative phase transition beyond their equilibrium counterpart.

While this idea has been realised at the level of abstract algebraic QFT, or via particular measurement models, there is still no general set of operational criteria characterising which measurements are physically implementable. In this work we adopt the local S-matrix formalism, and make use of a hierarchy of factorisation conditions that exclude both superluminal signalling and retrocausality, thereby providing such a criterion. Realising the local S-matrices through explicit interactions between smeared field operators and a pointer degree of freedom, we further derive local causality conditions for the induced Kraus operators, which guarantee the absence of signalling in \"impossible measurement\" scenarios.

For an 8x8 Hubbard model (128 qubits), the speedup is even more pronounced. These results demonstrate that classical simulation techniques developed in the context of quantum advantage benchmarking can provide practical tools for many-body physics."}

Beverland"], "title": "FPGA-tailored algorithms for real-time decoding of quantum LDPC codes", "comment": null, "summary": "Real-time decoding is crucial for fault-tolerant quantum computing but likely requires specialized hardware such as field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), whose parallelism can alter relative algorithmic performance. We analyze FPGA-tailored versions of three decoder classes for quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes: message passing, ordered statistics, and clustering. For message passing, we analyze the recently introduced Relay decoder and its FPGA implementation; for ordered statistics decoding (OSD), we introduce a filtered variant that concentrates computation on high-likelihood fault locations; and for clustering, we design an FPGA-adapted generalized union-find decoder. We design a systolic algorithm for Gaussian elimination on rank-deficient systems that runs in linear parallel time, enabling fast validity checks and local corrections in clustering and eliminating costly full-rank inversion in filtered-OSD. Despite these improvements, both remain far slower and less accurate than Relay, suggesting message passing is the most viable route to real-time qLDPC decoding."}

AD operates by post-selecting blocks of bits and extracting fewer high-fidelity bits, exhibiting a reduced QBER and thus lowering the amount of information that has to be disclosed during the information reconciliation step. In this work we present the first comprehensive finite key-size analysis of decoy-state BB84 enhanced via AD post-processing. We demonstrate that through the use of AD the maximum acceptable QBER increases from around $9.5\\%$ to around $17.3\\%$ for realistic key sizes. This result shows that substantial performance enhancements can be achieved in scenarios which are constrained by the maximum tolerable QBER via improvements of the post-processing method alone."}

Viewing the circuit as a tensor network, we decompose it into two parts: a symmetric layer, which defines an emergent gauge wavefunction in one higher dimension, and a random non-symmetric layer, which consists of random multiplicity tensors. For unitarity circuits, the bulk gauge state is deconfined, but under a generic non-unitary circuit (e.g. channels), the bulk gauge theory can undergo a decoherence-induced phase transition: for $G\\,{=}\\,\\mathbb{Z}_N$ with local symmetric noise, the circuit can act as a quantum error-correcting code with a distinguished logical subspace inheriting the $\\mathbb{Z}_N$-surface code's topological protection. We then identify that the charge sharpening transition from the measurement side is complementary to a decodability transition in the bulk: noise of the bulk can be interpreted as measurement from the environment. For $N\\,{\\leq}\\,4$, weak measurements drive a single transition from a charge-fuzzy phase with sharpening time $t_{\\#}\\sim e^{L}$ to a charge-sharp phase with $t_{\\#}\\sim \\mathcal{O}(1)$, corresponding to confinement that destroys logical information. For $N>4$, measurements generically generate an intermediate quasi-long-range ordered Coulomb phase with gapless photons and purification time $t_{\\#}\\sim \\mathcal{O}(L)$."}

We show that temporal fluctuations not only enhance the precision of SPADE imaging, but also drastically simplify the measurement required to recover full object information -- in the presence of fluctuations, SPADE can be replaced by the much simpler image inversion interferometry. Both gains are enabled by exploiting temporal cumulants of the detected signal."}

For special cases of intermediate segregation between components 1 and 2, the nucleation phase transition of a surfactant film of component 3 is obtained by exact solution. Additional exact results for the nucleation transition are derived in the limit of strong segregation between components 1 and 2. In this limit the exact first-order wetting phase boundary is obtained using analytical and numerical methods, and is contrasted with the exact nucleation and wetting phase boundary derived previously for a two-component Bose-Einstein condensate mixture at a hard optical wall. Exact results for the three-component mixture are compared with results from the double-parabola approximation used in an earlier work."}
