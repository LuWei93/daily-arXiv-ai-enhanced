Supp: 5 pages, 7 figures", "summary": "We report the experimental observation of vortex leapfrogging in a two-dimensional fluid of light. By imprinting two vortex-antivortex pairs and tracking their real-time evolution through phase-resolved imaging, we observe a dynamics that is accurately described by a point-vortex model with an outward background flow. By precisely controlling the initial vortex separation, we identify configurations in which leapfrogging breaks down and determine the corresponding dissipation mechanisms. The first originates from phase-slip events occurring at large injected velocities. The second arises when the injection of multi-charged vortices leads to the formation of a dispersive shock wave which acts as a continuous source of phase slippage. These mechanisms advance our understanding of vortex dynamics and dissipation in superfluids."}

Chinese Physics Letters, accepted", "summary": "Scalability remains a major challenge in building practical fault-tolerant quantum computers. Currently, the largest number of qubits achieved across leading quantum platforms ranges from hundreds to thousands. In atom arrays, scalability is primarily constrained by the capacity to generate large numbers of optical tweezers, and conventional techniques using acousto-optic deflectors or spatial light modulators struggle to produce arrays much beyond $\\sim 10,000$ tweezers. Moreover, these methods require additional microscope objectives to focus the light into micrometer-sized spots, which further complicates system integration and scalability. Here, we demonstrate the experimental generation of an optical tweezer array containing $280\\times 280$ spots using a metasurface, nearly an order of magnitude more than most existing systems. The metasurface leverages a large number of subwavelength phase-control pixels to engineer the wavefront of the incident light, enabling both large-scale tweezer generation and direct focusing into micron-scale spots without the need for a microscope. This result shifts the scalability bottleneck for atom arrays from the tweezer generation hardware to the available laser power. Furthermore, the array shows excellent intensity uniformity exceeding $90\\%$, making it suitable for homogeneous single-atom loading and paving the way for trapping arrays of more than $10,000$ atoms in the near future."}

Here we show that supersolidity can also emerge from mode coupling at a superfluid-solid interface, without modifying bulk interactions and for a broad class of superfluids. Using an analytical and numerical treatment of the coupled superfluid and phonon fields, we derive the criterion for a density-modulation instability driven by interfacial coupling and dependent on dimensionality. In superfluid helium, the instability first appears at the roton mode, while in a Bose-Einstein condensate with contact interactions it occurs at the lowest accessible wave vector set by the system size. Beyond the threshold, the ground state acquires an interfacial density modulation while the bulk remains superfluid, forming a hybrid superfluid-supersolid phase. Our results identify interfacial mode coupling as a promising route to supersolidity, enabling the simultaneous exploitation of interfacial supersolid and bulk superfluid quantum properties."}

Quasi-1D fermions with attractive interaction realize the Luther-Emery liquid, which exhibits a rich array of phenomena, many of which are qualitatively different from those exhibited by their repulsive counterpart. We use a Feshbach resonance to access attractive interactions with $^6$Li atoms. We measured the spin and charge dynamic structure factors using Bragg spectroscopy and find that, contrary to repulsive interactions, the spin wave propagates faster than the charge density wave, thus producing an inversion of the classic spin-charge separation. We also find that a small spin polarization strongly suppresses the spin gap in the measured Bragg spectra. Evidence for pairing are a reduction in spin correlations with increasing attraction and RF spectra consistent with an atom/molecule mixture."}

The resulting framework combines quantum-inspired computation with differentiable optimization, enabling reasoning to emerge as a process of amplitude evolution and interference-driven selection of self-consistent states. We develop the mathematical foundation of QCRM, define its parameterized circuit architecture, and show how logical rules can be encoded as unitary transformations over proposition-qubit states. We further formalize a training objective grounded in classical gradient descent over circuit parameters and discuss simulation-based implementations on classical hardware.

Two different strategies are proposed to solve the problem. In the first one, Bloch's assumption is first applied to the equations of motion, and then the nonlinear change of coordinates provided by the complex normal form style in the parametrisation method is applied. This direct procedure, which applies first the wave dependency to the original physical coordinates of the problem, is referred to as CNF-BP (for CNF applied with Bloch's assumption on physical coordinates). In the second strategy, the nonlinear change of coordinates provided by the parametrisation method, which relates the physical coordinates to the so-called normal coordinates, is first applied. Then the periodic assumption is used, thus imposing a Bloch wave ansatz on the normal coordinates. This method will be referred to as CNF-PN (for CNF with a periodic assumption on normal coordinates). In the conservative case, the CNF-PN strategy exhibits superior capability in capturing complex wave propagation phenomena, whereas the CNF-BP strategy encounters limitations in handling non-fundamental harmonics and the nonlinear interactions between host oscillators. For underdamped systems, the CNF-PN is rigorously validated and systematically compared against numerical techniques, a classical analytical perturbation technique (the method of multiple scales), and direct numerical time integration of annular chain structures."}

In this work, we present a framework for spectroscopic readout of chiral photonic topology in a single driven optical cavity containing a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate. We demonstrate that the cavity transmission power spectral density provides a direct and measurable proxy for a momentum- and frequency-resolved photonic Chern marker, enabling topological characteristics to be inferred from spectral data without the need for bulk-band tomography. In the loss-dominated regime, where cavity decay exceeds atomic dissipation, the power spectral density exhibits Dirac-like gapped hybrid modes with a vanishing Chern marker, indicating a trivial phase. When the dissipation imbalance is reversed, a bright, gap-spanning spectral ridge emerges, co-localized with peaks in both the Chern marker and Berry curvature. The complex spectrum reveals parity-time symmetric coalescences and gain-loss bifurcations, marking exceptional points and enabling chiral, gap-traversing transport. By linking noise spectroscopy to geometric and non-Hermitian topology in a minimal cavity-QED architecture, this work provides a framework for spectroscopic detection of topological order in driven quantum systems. This approach offers a pathway to compact, tunable topological photonics across a broad range of light-matter platforms, providing a method for the study and control of topological phases in hybrid quantum systems."}

During propagation, the red and blue-detuned sidebands accumulate different dispersive phase shifts, leading to oscillations in the transmitted modulation contrast as the modulation frequency is scanned.

This backflow actively counters dephasing losses, rapidly pushing the qubit into non-passive states, and results in a drastic enhancement of extractable work (Ergotropy). Leveraging the quantum first law, we precisely quantify this causal link between negative heat flux and QB performance enhancement.

Supplementary Material: 6 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "Second-harmonic generation (SHG) is a fundamental tool in modern laser technology, enabling coherent frequency conversion to remote optical bands, serving as the basis for self-referenced femtosecond lasers and quadrature-squeezed light sources. State-of-the-art SHG relies on bulk crystals and ridge waveguides, although continuous-wave (CW) SH efficiency in bulk crystals is limited by short interaction lengths and large mode areas. Ridge waveguides offer better performance with lower pump power requirements, yet must span several centimeters to deliver high output power, complicating fabrication and narrowing the bandwidth. Recently, SHG in periodically poled thin-film lithium niobate integrated photonic circuits has attracted significant interest, offering orders-of-magnitude improvement in SHG under CW pumping due to the stronger optical mode confinement. However, lithium niobate has a low optical damage threshold, even in MgO-doped substrates, which limits SH power output to well below the watt level. Here, we overcome this challenge and demonstrate 7 mm-long periodically poled thin-film lithium tantalate (PPLT) waveguides that achieve high SH output in the CW regime, with generated power exceeding 1 W and off-chip output above 0.5 W at 775 nm under 4.5 W pump power. PPLT offers a higher optical damage threshold than PPLN and supports watt-level operation. By optimizing electrode geometry and poling conditions, we obtain reproducible poling despite lithium tantalate's coercive field being nearly four times higher than that of MgO-doped lithium niobate. Although its effective nonlinearity is more than five times lower, we achieve watt-level CW output with a short waveguide, demonstrating the potential of PPLT circuits for high-power applications in integrated lasers, quantum photonics, AMO physics, optical clocks, and frequency metrology."}

For any representation of a finite group, we produce a quantum code with a code space invariant under the group action, providing passive error mitigation against errors belonging to the image of the representation. Furthermore, errors outside this scope are detected and diagnosed by performing a projective measurement onto the isotypic components corresponding to irreducible representations of the chosen group, effectively generalizing syndrome extraction to symmetry-resolved quantum measurements. We show that all stabilizer codes are a special case of this construction, including qudit stabilizer codes, and show that there is a natural one logical qubit code associated to the dihedral group.

Specifically, we show that a metalens optimized for full-color imaging can achieve image classification accuracy comparable to high-end, sensor-limited optics and consistently outperforms a hyperboloid metalens across a wide range of sensor pixel sizes. We further design an end-to-end single aperture metasurface for ImageNet classification and find that the optimized metasurface tends to balance the modulation transfer function (MTF) for each wavelength. Together, these findings highlight that the preservation of spatial frequency-domain information is an essential interpretable factor underlying ONN performance.

The resulting distribution $P(N,φ)$ is the quantum analogue of a Frequency Resolved Optical Gating (FROG) trace: whereas FROG reconstructs the classical complex spectral field $E(ω)$ from a spectrally resolved second harmonic of a pulse with its delayed self, our measurement reconstructs the Fock-space wavefunction or density matrix from binomially weighted self-interference.

Using a cumulant expansion approach, the computational complexity scales polynomially as opposed to exponentially with the number of emitters, enabling Monte Carlo sampling over a large number of realizations. The framework is applied to model negatively charged silicon-vacancy (SiV$^{-}$) centers inside diamond. Incorporating spatial disorder and inhomogeneous broadening, we obtain statistically averaged responses over hundreds of SiV$^{-}$ clusters. These simulations reveal two signatures of collective behavior. First, dynamics of fully inverted clusters show that superradiant emission occurs only with sufficiently large emitter number and high quantum efficiency. Unlike ideal Dicke superradiance, the burst is substantially suppressed by strong near-field dipole-dipole interaction, consistent with existing theoretical predictions. Second, under continuous-wave excitation we compute photoluminescence-excitation spectra, which exhibit interaction-induced broadening in the distribution of resonance peaks. The corresponding density of states also displays a non-zero skewness. Overall, by incorporating realistic inhomogeneities in emitter clusters, our framework is able to predict statistics for disordered ensembles that can be compared to experiments directly.

With three photons already, multiple pairwise combinations are possible, where each pair of photons can exhibit either bosonic, fermionic, or anyonic exchange symmetry. This gives rise to mixed symmetry systems that are not possible to achieve with two photon alone. We experimentally investigate how these symmetry configurations manifest themselves in the observed interference of three photons.

Single-qubit control and readout have been demonstrated recently using SFQ circuits coupled to superconducting qubits. Experiments where the SFQ electronics are co-located with the qubit have suffered from excess decoherence and loss due to quasiparticle poisoning of the qubit. A previous experiment by our group showed that moving the control electronics to the 3 K stage of the dilution refrigerator avoided this source of decoherence in a high-coherence 3D transmon geometry. In this paper, we also generate the pulses at the 3 K stage but have optimized the qubit design and control lines for scalable 2D transmon devices. We directly compare the qubit lifetime $T_1$, coherence time $T_2^*$ and gate fidelity when the qubit is controlled by the Josephson pulse generator (JPG) circuit versus the TSCE setup. We find agreement to within the daily fluctuations for $T_1$ and $T_2^*$, and agreement to within 10% for randomized benchmarking. We also performed interleaved randomized benchmarking on individual JPG gates demonstrating an average error per gate of $0.46$% showing good agreement with what is expected based on the qubit coherence and higher-state leakage. These results are an order of magnitude improvement in gate fidelity over our previous work and demonstrate that a Josephson microwave source operated at 3 K is a promising component for scalable qubit control."}

Three samples of standard single-mode optical fibers (SMF) are sequentially inserted in a syringe loaded with a 1 mL solution of single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) and methanol, and a high-power laser is injected into the fibers for 5 (SMF 1), 10 (SMF 2), and 20 (SMF 3) minutes. The CNT solution thermally expands and generates vortex acoustic flows, which are confined in the syringe cavity, significantly increasing the velocity and impact of nanotubes at the fiber tip. The resulting shock waves achieve estimated hypersonic velocities (5742 m/s) and high pressures (6.7 GPa), overcoming the silica tensile strength and ablating structured vortices in the fibers. The material, geometry, and depth profile of the vortices are characterized, providing details of mixing carbon and silica layers, increasing radially from the fiber core center and in thickness to the cladding for longer laser periods (850 nm to 10 micron thickness). The cross-sections of the measured vortices are compared to analytical simulations, revealing unprecedented Fibonacci helices drilling holes in the fiber core with a 5 micron maximum depth, while depositing nanoscale CNT-silica layers following Fibonacci spirals. These achievements point out a new route for laser-controlled deposition of nanoparticles and fabrication of vortex devices on fiber tips, which is promising for all-fiber vortex spatial phase modulators in optical communications, fiber sensors, high-power pulsed fiber lasers, and biomedical ultrasonic neurotransmitters."}

When integrated in quantum many-body dynamics, they can give rise to novel non-equilibrium phase transitions both at the level of each individual quantum trajectory and the averaged quantum channel. Experimentally resolving both transitions on realistic devices has been challenging due to limitations on the fidelity and the significant latency for performing mid-circuit measurements and feedback operations in real time. Here, we develop a superconducting quantum processor that enables global mid-circuit measurement with an average quantum non-demolition (QND) fidelity of 98.7% and fast conditional feedback with a 200 ns real-time decision latency. Using this platform, we demonstrate the coexistence of an absorbing-state transition in the quantum channel and a measurement-induced entanglement transition at the level of individual quantum trajectories. For the absorbing-state transition, we experimentally extract a set of critical exponents at the transition point, which is in excellent agreement with the directed percolation universality class. Crucially, the two transitions occur at distinct values of the tuning parameter.

We derive closed-form analytical expressions for the actions, which allow us to determine the two conditions to get periodic closed trajectories. We classify these trajectories through the indices $(s,t,\\ell)$. The caustic paraboloids that bound the motion provide a complete geometric characterization of admissible trajectories. Quantum mechanically, separability of the Schrödinger equation in parabolic coordinates yields eigenmodes described by Whittaker functions. We determine the energy spectrum and identify degeneracies arising not only from azimuthal symmetry but also from specific cavity deformations. A direct correspondence between classical trajectories and quantum eigenstates reveals that probability densities concentrate in the classically allowed region with controlled penetration into forbidden zones."}

Efficient inverse design benefits from differentiable models of light-structure interaction. While traditional full-wave solvers based on finite differences, finite elements, or Fourier modal methods have already been presented for that purpose, a dedicated tool adapted for performing multiple scattering simulations is still lacking. To overcome this limitation, we provide a multiple-scattering framework compatible to automatic differentiation, suitable for treating periodic and non-periodic arrangements of scatterers. It yields exact gradients regarding geometric and positional parameters in finite clusters and infinite metasurfaces. In this work, we use spheres as the elementary building blocks to demonstrate the framework's capabilities as a standalone tool. However, the framework is adaptable to arbitrarily shaped scatterers, provided the individual T-matrices are calculated using differentiable full-wave Maxwell solvers. Since the gradients are obtained simultaneously in a single backward pass, the framework is well-suited for moderately dimensional problems. It is also possible to combine multiple performance goals into a single objective function. The versatility of our method is illustrated in proof-of-concept examples that focus on various aspects of Kerker-type physics. In the first example, a finite cluster of scatterers is optimized in order to reach a high forward-to-backward scattering ratio, and we show experimental feasibility of the designs. In the second example, a metasurface made from multiple scatterers in each unit cell is designed to maximize the reflectance contrast between orthogonal linear polarizations of the incident light.

By intro ducing a chiral-symmetric Hamiltonian, this study reveals the topological effects at such temporal interfaces. We find that the reflection and refraction coefficients exhibit a topological braiding struc ture. This structure is directly determined by the difference in the topological invariants across the interface, establishing a bulk-boundary correspondence for temporal interfaces in non-Hermitian systems.

While this enables studies of many-body physics, it limits the flexibility and tunability of the system as a quantum platform. Here, we demonstrate an array of trapped ions in individual trapping sites whose motional modes can be controllably coupled and decoupled by tuning the local applied confining potential for each ion. We show that a single motional quantum, or phonon, can be coherently shared among two or three ions confined at the vertices of an equilateral triangle 30 $μ$m on a side. We can adiabatically tune the ion participation in the motional modes around a closed contour in configuration space, observing that the single-phonon wavefunction acquires a topological Berry phase if the contour encircles a conical intersection of motional eigenvalue surfaces. We observe this phase by single-phonon interference and study its breakdown as the motional mode tuning becomes non-adiabiatic.

However, the requirement for tunable and low-noise laser sources considerably increases the cost and the size of the system, thereby limiting the industrial applicability of the microresonator-based technology. Here, we explore the possibility of using a low-cost fixed-frequency semiconductor laser as the pump laser to perform radiofrequency electrometry. A resonant mode in a lithium niobate microresonator is frequency-locked to the laser using the electrooptic effect. This same effect also underlies the radiofrequency electric-field sensing mechanism. Our experimental results show that the electrometry resolution can be maintained at signal frequencies beyond the optical resonance bandwidth and that the signal-to-noise ratio does not change with varied coupling conditions as long as the laser frequency noise is the dominant noise source of the system. In addition, narrowband electrooptic sensitivity enhancement is observed at frequencies of the microresonator's piezoelectric resonances, resulting in a resolution enhancement factor of approximately 3 at signal frequencies around 4 MHz. Our work advances the photonic resonant electrometry technology by studying the bandwidth limitation, and opens the road to the employment of low-cost lasers in high-resolution sensing applications."}

A noise-robust wrapped-number search is used to select per-pixel integer pairs (k1, k2), and a global refinement with circular TV regularization and soft bounds improves stability and preserves height discontinuities. The approach is validated through rigorous scattering-model-based simulations and experiments on structured silicon samples, demonstrating accurate height recovery in regimes where single-wavelength FPT exhibits phase wrapping. We analyze the limits of the FPT forward model and identify aspect ratio (AR) and phase modulation transfer function (ph-MTF) as key predictors of reconstruction fidelity.

While the mathematical theory underpinning quantum correlations between spacelike separated systems has been well-established since the 1930s, the mathematical theory for correlations between non-spacelike separated systems is much less developed. In this work, we develop the theory of what we refer to as \"local-density operators\", which we view as joint states for possibly non-spacelike separated quantum systems. Local-density operators are unit trace operators whose marginals are genuine density operators, which we show not only subsumes the notion of density operator, but also several extensions of the notion of density operator into the spatiotemporal domain, such as pseudo-density operators and quantum states over time. More importantly, we prove a result which establishes a one-to-one correspondence between local-density operators and what we refer to as \"Dirac measures\", which are complex-valued measures on the space of separable projectors associated with two quantum systems. In the case that one of the systems is the trivial quantum system with a one-dimensional Hilbert space, our result recovers the fundamental result known as Gleason's Theorem, which implies that the Born rule from quantum theory is the only way in which one may assign probabilities to the outcomes of measurements performed on quantum systems in a non-contextual manner. As such, our results establish a direct generalization of Gleason's Theorem to measurements performed on possibly non-spacelike separated systems, thus extending the mathematical theory of quantum correlations across space to quantum correlations across space and time."}

Using quasi-bound states in the continuum (q-BICs), we demonstrate how to control the hybridization of modes with opposite symmetries, resulting in Rabi-like splitting between the hybrid states in the regime of strong electromagnetic mode coupling. Beyond revealing the physical origin of the hybrid modes, our model predicts and explains the emergence of dual-band asymmetric reflection and absorption, and how to achieve maximum directional absorption difference. The theoretical predictions are verified by full-wave simulations, showing very good agreement with theory. Furthermore, very strong reciprocal bianisotropy is demonstrated with the use of q-BICs in a deeply subwavelength metasurface in the optical frequency range.

The resulting measurement directly samples the Q function of the input state as if it were acted upon by a squeezing operator whose strength is a tunable experimental parameter : the beamsplitter's reflectivity. We experimentally realize this technique using a robust polarization-encoded double homodyne detection to characterize a squeezed vacuum state. Our results demonstrate the controlled deformation of the measured Q function's phase-space distribution, confirming that unbalanced double homodyne detection is a versatile tool for simultaneous quantum state manipulation and characterization."}

The setup consists of a microwave cavity mode coupled to magnons in a single-crystal yttrium iron garnet sphere, which in turn are hybridized with a vibrational mechanical mode through magnetostrictive interaction. In the Hermitian regime, strong photon-magnon coupling generates a single transparency window in the cavity transmission, which splits into a doublet when the magnon is coherently hybridized with the mechanical mode via magnomechanical coupling. This establishes a versatile platform in which the transparency spectrum can be engineered from single- to multi-window response using experimentally accessible, scaled magnomechanical interactions. When a non-Hermitian coupling is introduced, the system enters a parity-time-broken regime in which the transparency ceases to be purely passive and becomes gain assisted, leading to asymmetric transmission with amplification on one side of the resonance and enhanced absorption on the other. By tuning the cavity detuning, we convert magnomechanical transparency into Fano-type line shapes with strongly non-Lorentzian phase dispersion and map their deformation into asymmetric, gain-assisted Fano ridges in the joint space of probe and magnon detunings. Finally, we analyze the associated group delay and show that both slow- and fast-light behavior can be widely tuned by varying the photon-magnon and magnomechanical couplings together with the non-Hermitian strength, highlighting parity-time-symmetric cavity magnomechanics as a promising platform for reconfigurable quantum signal processing and enhanced sensing."}

In these protocols, pre-shared entanglement enables either the faithful transfer of quantum states or the transmission of more information than is possible classically. However, channel losses degrade the shared states, reducing teleportation fidelity and the information advantage in superdense coding. Here, we investigate how to mitigate these effects by optimising the measurements applied by the communicating parties. We formulate the problem as an optimisation over general positive operator-valued measurements (POVMs) and compare the results with physically realisable noiseless attenuation (NA) and noiseless linear amplification (NLA) circuits. For teleportation, NLA/NA and optimised POVMs improve the average fidelity by up to 78% while maintaining feasible success probabilities. For superdense coding, they enhance the quantum advantage over the classical channel capacity by more than 100% in some regimes and shift the break-even point, thereby extending the tolerable range of losses. Notably, the optimal POVMs effectively reduce to NA or NLA, showing that simple, experimentally accessible operations already capture the essential performance gains."}

We demonstrate that the cavity transmission power spectral density provides a direct and measurable proxy for a momentum- and frequency-resolved photonic Chern marker, enabling topological characteristics to be inferred from spectral data without the need for bulk-band tomography. In the loss-dominated regime, where cavity decay exceeds atomic dissipation, the power spectral density exhibits Dirac-like gapped hybrid modes with a vanishing Chern marker, indicating a trivial phase. When the dissipation imbalance is reversed, a bright, gap-spanning spectral ridge emerges, co-localized with peaks in both the Chern marker and Berry curvature. The complex spectrum reveals parity-time symmetric coalescences and gain-loss bifurcations, marking exceptional points and enabling chiral, gap-traversing transport. By linking noise spectroscopy to geometric and non-Hermitian topology in a minimal cavity-QED architecture, this work provides a framework for spectroscopic detection of topological order in driven quantum systems.

In this work, we develop a framework that characterizes and quantifies the programmability of Lindbladian semigroups by combining physically implementable retrieval maps with time varying program states. Within this framework, we identify quantum programmable classes enabled by symmetry and stochastic structure, including covariant semigroups and fully dissipative Pauli Lindbladians with finite program dimension. We further provide a necessary condition for physical programmability that rules out coherent generators and typical dissipators generating amplitude damping. For such nonphysically programmable cases, we construct explicit protocols with finite resources. Finally, we introduce an operational programming cost, defined via the number of samples required to program the Lindbladian, and establish its core structural properties, such as continuity and faithfulness. These results provide a notion of programming cost for Lindbladians, bridge programmable channel theory and open system dynamics, and yield symmetry driven compression schemes and actionable resource estimates for semigroup simulation and control in noisy quantum technologies."}

We find that, in several notable instances, they have advanced our understanding of many-body quantum dynamics. Although many of these insights could in principle have been obtained theoretically or numerically, they were nevertheless first achieved using quantum processors. While a broad landscape of problems beyond non-equilibrium dynamics still awaits exploration, it is encouraging that quantum simulators are already beginning to challenge and refine our conventional wisdom."}

By analyzing the linear entanglement entropy of coherent states prepared in the classical chaotic and regular regions of the semiclassical phase space, we demonstrate that quantum-classical correspondence can be achieved in the RSM with large atom-light frequency ratios. While this correspondence fails in the resonant Rabi model because its truncated photon number is insufficient to approach the large quantum number limit, we discovered that in the resonant RSM when the nonlinear Stark coupling $U \\to \\pm 1$, the time-averaged linear entanglement entropy correlates strongly with the semiclassical phase space. In particular, when $U \\to -1$, the truncated photon number in the resonant RSM is very close to that in the resonant Rabi model, but the time-averaged linear entanglement entropy still corresponds well with the semiclassical phase space. This result demonstrates that quantum-classical correspondence can be realized in the few-body resonant RSM."}

In this work, we demonstrate deterministic quantum state transfer and remote entanglement generation between fixed-frequency superconducting qubits on separate chips. To compensate for the sender-receiver mismatch, we employ a frequency-tunable photon-generation technique which enables us to adjust the photon frequency without modifying circuit parameters. To enhance the frequency tunability, we implement broadband transfer resonators composed of two coupled coplanar-waveguide resonators, achieving a bandwidth of more than 100 MHz. This broadband design enables successful quantum communication across a 30-MHz range of photon frequencies between the remote qubits. Quantum process tomography reveals state transfer fidelities of around 78% and Bell-state fidelities of around 73% across the full frequency range.

Yet the drive toward larger experiments has led to the replacement of experimentally demanding single-photon sources with Gaussian states, thereby diminishing the available non-Gaussianity-a critical quantum resource. As the community broadens its focus from the initial sampling task to possible real-world applications, it becomes crucial to quantify the performance cost associated with reducing non-Gaussian resources and to benchmark sampling platforms that employ different input states.\n  To address this need, we introduce the Paderborn Quantum Sampler (PaQS), a hybrid platform capable of performing sampling experiments with eight Gaussian or non-Gaussian input states in a 12-mode interferometer within a single experimental run. This architecture enables direct, side-by-side benchmarking of distinct sampling regimes under otherwise identical conditions.

The prevalent technique of post-selection verifies the creation of an entangled state by detecting and thus destroying it. Heralding offers a solution in which measuring ancillary photons in auxiliary modes signals the state generation without the need to measure it. Here, we report an experiment to generate a three-mode two-photon NOON state, where the detection of a single photon in one heralding mode signifies the presence of the state in three target modes. We validate the generated state by estimating a fidelity of 0.823 +/- 0.018 with respect to an ideal three-mode NOON state and certifying genuine multipartite entanglement. By virtue of the high success probability and small resource overhead of our scheme, our work provides a theoretical and experimental stepping stone for entangled multi-mode state generation, which is realizable with current technology. These multi-mode entangled states represent a key direction for linear optical quantum information that is complementary to multi-qubit state encoding."}

We offer a structural explanation from minimal constraints on finite descriptions of admissible histories. Assume that histories admit finite, self-delimiting (prefix-free) generative codes that can be decoded sequentially in a single forward pass. These purely syntactic requirements define a minimal descriptive cost, interpretable as a smoothed minimal program length, that is additive over local segments. First, any continuous local additive cost whose stationary sector coincides with the empirically identified classical variational sector is forced into a unique Euler--Lagrange equivalence class. Hence the universal form of an action is fixed by descriptional structure alone, while the specific microscopic Lagrangian and couplings remain system-dependent semantic input. Second, independently of microscopic stochasticity, finite prefix-free languages exhibit exponential redundancy: many distinct programs encode the same coarse history, and this redundancy induces a universal exponential multiplicity weight on histories. Requiring this weight to be real and bounded below selects a real Euclidean representative for stable local bosonic systems, yielding the standard Euclidean path-integral form. When Osterwalder--Schrader reflection positivity holds, the Euclidean measure reconstructs a unitary Lorentzian amplitude."}

Double homodyne detection provides a powerful method for the direct measurement of the Husimi Q quasi-probability distribution, offering a complete state representation in a simple experimental setting and a limited time frame. Here, we demonstrate that double homodyne detection can serve as more than a passive measurement apparatus. By intentionally unbalancing the input beamsplitter that splits the quantum signal, we show that the detection scheme itself performs an effective squeezing or anti-squeezing transformation on the state being measured. The resulting measurement directly samples the Q function of the input state as if it were acted upon by a squeezing operator whose strength is a tunable experimental parameter : the beamsplitter's reflectivity. We experimentally realize this technique using a robust polarization-encoded double homodyne detection to characterize a squeezed vacuum state. Our results demonstrate the controlled deformation of the measured Q function's phase-space distribution, confirming that unbalanced double homodyne detection is a versatile tool for simultaneous quantum state manipulation and characterization."}

The setup consists of a microwave cavity mode coupled to magnons in a single-crystal yttrium iron garnet sphere, which in turn are hybridized with a vibrational mechanical mode through magnetostrictive interaction. In the Hermitian regime, strong photon-magnon coupling generates a single transparency window in the cavity transmission, which splits into a doublet when the magnon is coherently hybridized with the mechanical mode via magnomechanical coupling. This establishes a versatile platform in which the transparency spectrum can be engineered from single- to multi-window response using experimentally accessible, scaled magnomechanical interactions. When a non-Hermitian coupling is introduced, the system enters a parity-time-broken regime in which the transparency ceases to be purely passive and becomes gain assisted, leading to asymmetric transmission with amplification on one side of the resonance and enhanced absorption on the other. By tuning the cavity detuning, we convert magnomechanical transparency into Fano-type line shapes with strongly non-Lorentzian phase dispersion and map their deformation into asymmetric, gain-assisted Fano ridges in the joint space of probe and magnon detunings. Finally, we analyze the associated group delay and show that both slow- and fast-light behavior can be widely tuned by varying the photon-magnon and magnomechanical couplings together with the non-Hermitian strength, highlighting parity-time-symmetric cavity magnomechanics as a promising platform for reconfigurable quantum signal processing and enhanced sensing."}

In this work, we present a framework for spectroscopic readout of chiral photonic topology in a single driven optical cavity containing a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate. We demonstrate that the cavity transmission power spectral density provides a direct and measurable proxy for a momentum- and frequency-resolved photonic Chern marker, enabling topological characteristics to be inferred from spectral data without the need for bulk-band tomography. In the loss-dominated regime, where cavity decay exceeds atomic dissipation, the power spectral density exhibits Dirac-like gapped hybrid modes with a vanishing Chern marker, indicating a trivial phase. When the dissipation imbalance is reversed, a bright, gap-spanning spectral ridge emerges, co-localized with peaks in both the Chern marker and Berry curvature. The complex spectrum reveals parity-time symmetric coalescences and gain-loss bifurcations, marking exceptional points and enabling chiral, gap-traversing transport. By linking noise spectroscopy to geometric and non-Hermitian topology in a minimal cavity-QED architecture, this work provides a framework for spectroscopic detection of topological order in driven quantum systems.

This class encompasses not only standard uniformly controlled gates (UCGs) but also a wide range of circuits with uniformly controlled structures. However, their circuit-depth and gate-count complexities have not been systematically analyzed within a unified framework. In this work, we study the general decomposition problem for UCG and UCG-like structure. We then introduce the restricted Uniformly Controlled Gates (rUCGs) as a unified algebraic model, defined by a 2-divisible Abelian group that models the controlled gate set. This model captures uniformly controlled rotations, multi-qubit uniformly controlled gates, and diagonal unitaries. Furthermore, this model also naturally incorporates k-sparse version (k-rUCGs), where only a subset of control qubits participate in each multi-qubit gate. Building on this algebraic model, we develop a general framework. For an n-control rUCG, the framework reduce the gate complexity from ${O(n2^n)}$ to ${O(2^n})$ and the circuit depth from ${O(2^n\\log n)}$ to ${O(2^n\\log n/n)}$. The framework further provides systematic size and depth bounds for k-rUCGs by exploiting sparsity in the control space, with same optimization coefficient as rUCG, respectively. Empirical evaluations on representative QAOA circuits and quantum state preparation both confirm reductions in depth and size. Crucially, these results highlight that the rUCG model and its associated decomposition framework unify circuits previously considered structurally distinct under a single, asymptotically optimal synthesis paradigm."}

Here, we generalize the theory by studying a broad class of quantum models, including the XY model, the XXZ model, the XYZ model, and the $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ clock model in one dimension, subject to complex external magnetic field. For the XY, XXZ and XYZ models, we find that the complex field breaks parity symmetry and induces oscillations of the ground state between the two parity sectors, giving rise to fidelity zeros within the ordered phases. For the $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ clock model, the complex field splits the real part of the ground-state energy between the neutral sector ($q=0$) and the charged sectors ($q=1,2$), while preserving the degeneracy within the charged sector.

We apply our analysis to small quantum codes, and show that they exhibit non-Markovian dynamics even for very simple physical noise models. We show that non-Markovianity can emerge from Markovian physical operations if (and only if) the physical qubits are not necessarily returned to the code subspace after every round of QEC. In this situation, the syndrome qubits can act as a memory, mediating time correlations and enabling violation of the Markov condition.

Here we show that supersolidity can also emerge from mode coupling at a superfluid-solid interface, without modifying bulk interactions and for a broad class of superfluids. Using an analytical and numerical treatment of the coupled superfluid and phonon fields, we derive the criterion for a density-modulation instability driven by interfacial coupling and dependent on dimensionality. In superfluid helium, the instability first appears at the roton mode, while in a Bose-Einstein condensate with contact interactions it occurs at the lowest accessible wave vector set by the system size. Beyond the threshold, the ground state acquires an interfacial density modulation while the bulk remains superfluid, forming a hybrid superfluid-supersolid phase. Our results identify interfacial mode coupling as a promising route to supersolidity, enabling the simultaneous exploitation of interfacial supersolid and bulk superfluid quantum properties."}
