The photon either reaches the boundary for a first passage or is absorbed. Projecting the walk onto the axial direction produces a one-dimensional alternating process whose peaks and valleys correspond to changes in the sign of the projected step. This reduction preserves first-return and first-passage events and leads to a representation in terms of Motzkin-type polynomials. The analytical formulation is complete except for boundary-constrained return terms, which appear as high-order integrals. We treat these contributions with a single truncation factor determined from Monte Carlo simulations of first-return distributions over a wide range of anisotropy g and scattering steps ms. The resulting factor follows a Cauchy distribution. Incorporating it yields first-return probabilities in agreement with full three-dimensional Monte Carlo to within 2% for g<=0.7. The approach gives backscattering coefficients from phase-function integrals and provides an efficient alternative to full three-dimensional simulations for problems of radiative transport in semi-infinite media."}

Among available microcomb generation methods, hybrid cavities uniquely co-locate gain and Kerr dynamics, where the lasing mode directly resonates in the nonlinear microcavity, simultaneously enabling self-sustained and highly efficient microcomb generation. However, their implementation is often limited by partial integration or the need for external injection, which complicates operation architecture, raises power and hampers system miniaturization. In this work, we present a fully integrated hybrid cavity for self-sustained microcomb generation, relying solely on the co-oscillation of lasing and Kerr nonlinearity without external driving. The system collapses the pump laser, nonlinear resonator and feedback loops into a minimalist on-chip two-element cavity, consisting of a high-Q microresonator with engineered intracavity reflection and a reflective semiconductor optical amplifier (RSOA). The scheme delivers self-starting operation and stable performance without active feedback. The generated coherent microcomb achieves intrinsic linewidths below 1 kHz and integrated linewidths around 100 kHz, with self-sustained operation exceeding 24 hours. This ultra-compact architecture provides a practical path toward scalable, coherent multi-wavelength sources for integrated photonic systems."}

Systematic Z_scan measurements reveal a pronounced increase in nonlinear absorption with decreasing thickness. Especially in the ENZ spectral region, the TD TiN films exhibit nearly two orders of magnitude stronger nonlinear absorption over a broad range of incidence angles as compared to conventional thin films. The enhanced nonlinear absorption observed is well described by a nonlinear nonlocal electromagnetic response model that accounts for electron confinement effects unique to the TD plasmonic systems.

Specifically, we focus on Sauter-like pulse trains with random time delays between successive pulses, drawn from a Gaussian distribution wherein the extent of fluctuations is controlled by the standard deviation $σ_T$ of the distribution. We find that increasing $σ_T$ leads to a dramatic transformation in the longitudinal momentum spectrum. The well-known fringe pattern, akin to that in the multi-slit interference, gets significantly modified. The averaged spectra exhibit a robust Gaussian-like envelope with residual oscillations, which are much more prominent in the central momentum region. Notably, we find that in certain cases, stochastic time delays lead to a pronounced enhancement in the central peak of the distribution function for pulse train containing $N$ pulses. For example, for $N=20$ pulses, $σ_T \\approx 31$ $[m^{-1}]$(about $17\\%$ of the mean time delay) yields nearly a tenfold increase in the central peak, which for $σ_T \\approx 50$ $[m^{-1}]$ (about $27\\%$ of the mean time delay), scales up to $10^3.$ This may open up new possibilities for optimizing multi-pulse field configurations and guide future experimental designs aimed at maximizing EPPs creation."}

Nevertheless, one can distinguish a low-temperature glassy regime, where disorder plays an important role on intermediate length and time scales, from a high-temperature regime, where disorder becomes irrelevant. In the second scenario, below a temperature $T_c$, the RG flow exhibits a singularity at a finite value of the RG momentum scale. We propose that this singularity signals a lack of thermalization and the existence of a localized phase for $T<T_c$. We provide a description of this low-temperature localized phase within a droplet picture and highlight a number of possible similarities with characteristics of many-body localized phases, including non-thermal behavior, avalanche instabilities and many-body resonances, the structure of the many-body spectrum, and slow dynamics in the ergodic phase.

By transforming spatial information into the angular frequency domain, VortexNet isolates azimuthal features that persist despite scattering, enabling accurate topological charge classification even in complex optical environments. The results reveal that OAM-specific angular correlations can survive multiple scattering and be decoded through angular-domain learning. This establishes a new paradigm for structured-light analysis in complex medium, where deep learning enables the recovery of topological information beyond the reach of classical optics, paving the way for resilient photonic systems in communication, sensing, and imaging."}

However, such control is typically limited to magnetization transverse to light's polarization plane, or out-of-plane magnetism in 2D materials, while in-plane magnetic moments have remained largely unexplored. This is due to the difficulty of generating electronic orbital angular momentum components within light's polarization plane. Here we overcome this limitation, demonstrating complete three-dimensional, all-optical control of magnetism in 2D materials. Using first-principles simulations, we show that a tailored, two-color laser field can induce and steer magnetic moments in any direction with the relative angle between the laser polarizations playing a key parameter in coherent control. We analyze the physical mechanism of this process and show that it arises from a simultaneous breaking of time-reversal and spatial-inversion symmetries in the two-color laser. In-plane orbital moments are introduced via non-zero out-of-plane longitudinal photogalvanic currents enabled by broken inversion and mirror symmetries, while time-reversal symmetry breaking enables build-up of spin-rotation processes through spin-orbit coupling, translating the orbital moments to transient magnetism. Our findings demonstrate a full 3D coherent control scheme for transient magnetic states on femtosecond timescales driven by tailored lasers, and can be used to develop novel spectroscopies for magnetism, all-optical magnetic switching for ultrafast spintronics, and novel information storage capabilities."}

Our construction encodes a logical qubit in the quantum double $D(G)$ of a non-Abelian group $G$ on a triangular spatial patch. The logical gate is implemented transversally by stacking on the spatial region a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase specified by a group 2-cocycle. The Bravyi--König theorem limits the unitary gates implementable by constant-depth quantum circuits on Pauli stabilizer codes in $D$ dimensions to the $D$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy. We bypass this, by constructing transversal unitary gates at arbitrary levels of the Clifford hierarchy purely in 2D, without sacrificing locality or fault tolerance, however at the cost of using the quantum double of a non-Abelian group $G$. Specifically, for $G = D_{4N}$, the dihedral group of order $8N$, we realize the phase gate $T^{1/N} = \\mathrm{diag}(1, e^{iπ/(4N)})$ in the logical $\\overline{Z}$ basis. For $8N = 2^n$, this gate lies at the $n$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy and, importantly, has a qubit-only realization: we show that it can be constructed in terms of Clifford-hierarchy stabilizers for a code with $n$ physical qubits on each edge of the lattice.

We begin by analyzing the evolution of a BEC from filled-sphere to hollow-shell geometries, illustrating the necessity of microgravity conditions to avoid gravitational sag. We then analyze collective modes structure across this evolution and pinpoint a universal dip in the frequency spectra as well as mode reconfiguration due to inner-surface excitations as robust signatures of the hollowing-out transition. Turning to vortex physics, we show that the closed-surface topology enforces vortex-antivortex configurations in shell-shaped BECs and that the natural annihilation of these pairs can be stabilized by rotation, with the critical rotation rate depending on shell thickness. In the thermodynamic domain, we investigate the interplay between shell inflation and the BEC phase transition, where adiabatic expansions lead to condensate depletion. This behavior motivates a study of the nonequilibrium dynamics of shell-shaped BECs; we perform such a study by constructing a time-dependent dynamic technique that can capture the evolution in both adiabatice and non-adiabatic regimes.

Here, we examine a one-dimensional field-theoretic model of the system and find that the phase-locking behaviour can be understood in terms of the presence of the longitudinal harmonic trap, and that the additional degrees of freedom known to be present in the experiment do not appear to play a significant role. Therefore, the experimental setup provides a good simulator of the sine-Gordon quantum field theory, even out of equilibrium, if the inhomogeneous background induced by the trap is taken into account. Furthermore, our results support the idea that modifying the longitudinal trap to a box shape should result in agreement with standard sine-Gordon dynamics.

We experimentally validate the existence of these eigenstates and demonstrate the energy-, polarization- and wave-vector-dependence of this metasurface. By tuning the incident k-vector, certain polarization-energy eigenstates are strongly reflected allowing for uses in angle-tunable polarization filters and light sources."}

Second order nonlinear processes, like second harmonic generation (SHG), typically require non-centrosymmetric crystals to be realized. Here, we experimentally demonstrate enhanced SHG response by using a gold nanocavity array forming a plasmonic metasurface absorber where titanium dioxide (TiO2), a centrosymmetric dielectric material, with subwavelength thickness is deposited in the realized nanogaps. While such dielectric material has an extremely low second order nonlinear susceptibility, we observe 105-fold boosting in the nonlinear SHG process mainly due to the surface nonlinear susceptibility of the gold metal aided by the significant electric field enhancement that occurs in the nanogaps due to the formed nanocavity resonance. The experimental results obtained are theoretically explained with extensive and rigorous nonlinear simulations that consider all the bulk and surface linear and nonlinear material properties. The presented robust harmonic generation from an ultrathin plasmonic metasurface can be used in nonlinear and quantum integrated photonic applications."}

However, if the Backlink shows asymmetry between the two propagation directions, the effective optical pathlengths of the counter-propagating beams can introduce a differential phase noise, called non-reciprocity, into the main interferometric measurement that will limit the achievable accuracy in time-delay interferometry (TDI) post-processing. Hence, it is important to understand the properties of the Backlink to ensure that it will not compromise the interferometric detection. The Three-Backlink Experiment (3BL), which consists of an optical test facility with two rotatable benches, was designed under the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) framework to study the performance of three Backlink configurations: two fiber-based and one free-beam scheme. In this paper, we report recent experimental results from the 3BL. We describe the commissioning and the subsequent noise mitigation.

In a demonstration experiment, we launch ultrashort infrared pump pulses at 1-$μ$m wavelength (285-THz frequency) into silicon nitride waveguides, where soliton formation and fission leads to generation of dispersive waves in the visible range. Efficient input coupling and controlled excitation of the fundamental supermodes of the dual-core waveguide is provided with adiabatic tapers and a dual-prong input structure. For the dual-core waveguide, the short-wavelength dispersive wave is located at 540~nm (green, 555~THz), which is blue-shifted by 80~nm (70~THz) compared to that of the single-core waveguide. Simultaneously, the dual-core waveguide generates broadband radiation spanning from the blue into the UV range, reaching to below 350~nm (above 855~THz), with typically a spectral density 25~dB below that of the dispersive wave. The broadband component can be addressed to third harmonic generation and is not observed in single-core supercontinuum generation. Numerical modeling shows good agreement with experimental measurements. The demonstrated dual-core approach and dedicated input coupling appear to hold promise also for other waveguide structures, independent of specific materials or core dimensions, by providing shorter wavelengths than with the respective single-core waveguide."}

However, its application in qubit control is limited by residual intensity crosstalk at neighboring sites and by a nonzero background floor in the far wings of the addressing beam, leading to accumulated errors from many exposed qubits. Here, we present an all-optical scheme that mitigates both effects using a single digital micromirror device (DMD) operated in a double-pass configuration, in which light interacts with two separate regions of the same device. In the first pass, one region of the DMD is placed in a Fourier plane and implements a binary-amplitude hologram for individual addressing, while in the second pass a different region serves as a programmable intermediate image-plane aperture for spatial filtering. By multiplexing the Fourier-plane hologram to include secondary holograms, we generate weak auxiliary fields that interfere destructively with unwanted light at selected sites, while image-plane filtering suppresses the residual tail at larger distances. Together, these techniques maintain relative intensity crosstalk at or below $10^{-5}$ ($-50\\,\\mathrm{dB}$) across the full field of view relevant for qubit addressing, and further reduce the far-wing background to approximately $10^{-6}$ at large distances from the addressed qubit, approaching the detection limit.

Here, we explore the DTC in a disorder-free, periodically kicked XXZ spin chain, which is stabilized by the Floquet strong Hilbert space fragmentation. We numerically show the period-doubling response of the conventional DTC order, and uncover a multiple-period response with beating dynamics due to the coherent interplay of multiple $π$-pairs in the Floquet spectrum of small-size systems. The lifetime of the DTC order exhibits independence of the driving frequency and a power-law dependence on the ZZ interaction strength. It also grows exponentially with the system size, as a hallmark of the strong fragmentation inherent to the Floquet model. We analytically reveal the approximate conservation of the magnetization and domain-wall number in the Floquet operator for the emergent strong fragmentation, which is consistent with numerical results of the dimensionality ratio of symmetry subspaces. The rigidity and phase regime of the DTC order are identified through finite-size scaling of the Floquet-spectrum-averaged mutual information, as well as via dynamical probes. Our work establishes the Floquet Hilbert space fragmentation as a disorder-free mechanism for sustaining nontrivial temporal orders in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems."}

We demonstrate that both the magnitude and angular position of the photonic SHE can be controlled by varying the relative phase $φ$ between the driving optical fields and the strength of the microwave coupling $Ω_μ$. At zero probe field detuning ($Δ_p = 0$) and $φ=0,π$, the photonic SHE magnitude reaches to upper limit equal to the half of the incident beam waist, and remains largely unaffected by the microwave strength $Ω_μ$, but its angular position shifts linearly with increasing $Ω_μ$. At intermediate phases, especially at $φ= π/2$, the magnitude of the photonic SHE exponentially decreases with the increase of $Ω_μ$. Interestingly, we observed microwave-controlled switching of photonic SHE by tuning the relative phase $φ$ at an optimized value of $Ω_μ$ and $Ω_{c}$. In contrast, at $Δ_p = \\pm Ω_c$, a maximum photonic SHE equal to half of the incident beam waist occurs at $φ\\leq π$ and $Ω_μ \\geq Ω_p$, where both real and imaginary parts of the susceptibility vanish, yielding a unit refractive index.

Depending on the symmetry and dimensionality of the bulk systems, different edge states emulating soliton, quantum integer and quantum spin Hall effects have been realized. A major concern in photonics is how one can shape the strength and polarisation of electromagnetic fields to suit different applications. Here, we show zero-dimensional (0D) interface state arising from one-dimensional (1D) dissipative topological photonic crystals exhibit strong field localisation and spin-momentum locking thanks to its complex classical analogue Dirac mass parameter. By using spatiotemporal coupled mode theory to formulate 1D photonic crystals and their corresponding Jackiw Rebbi-like (JR) interface state, we find the interaction between two energy bands at high symmetry points plays a major role in defining not only the topological triviality of the crystals but also its complex Dirac mass parameter. More importantly, when two topological trivial and nontrivial bulk systems are brought together to form a JR state, while the real part of the Dirac mass parameter governs the spectral and spatial field localisations of the interface state, the imaginary part gives rise to a net flow of energy towards the interface and a transverse spin angular momentum, resulting in a strong spin-momentum locking.

Our novel action set enables the RL agent to efficiently navigate this inherently non-convex optimization landscape. The action set, derived from Thompson's group $F$, is applicable to a broad class of sequential decision problems whose states can be represented as bounded sequences. We demonstrate that our RL agent can learn pulse sequences that minimize dephasing without requiring explicit knowledge of the underlying noise spectrum. This work opens the possibility for real-time learning of optimal dynamical decoupling sequences on qubits which are dephasing-limited.

Here, we present an all-optical scheme that mitigates both effects using a single digital micromirror device (DMD) operated in a double-pass configuration, in which light interacts with two separate regions of the same device. In the first pass, one region of the DMD is placed in a Fourier plane and implements a binary-amplitude hologram for individual addressing, while in the second pass a different region serves as a programmable intermediate image-plane aperture for spatial filtering. By multiplexing the Fourier-plane hologram to include secondary holograms, we generate weak auxiliary fields that interfere destructively with unwanted light at selected sites, while image-plane filtering suppresses the residual tail at larger distances. Together, these techniques maintain relative intensity crosstalk at or below $10^{-5}$ ($-50\\,\\mathrm{dB}$) across the full field of view relevant for qubit addressing, and further reduce the far-wing background to approximately $10^{-6}$ at large distances from the addressed qubit, approaching the detection limit. These results provide a compact, DMD-based solution for low-crosstalk optical holographic qubit addressing that is directly applicable to trapped ions and other spatially ordered quantum systems."}

We mitigate this by a regulated, partially resummed reconstruction of the dynamical map around a Davies reference semigroup, expressed through a non--Markovian density-matrix correlator C(t) that remains bounded at late times. An exactly solvable rotating-wave benchmark links generator growth to interference-induced near-zeros of the coherence and shows how the reconstruction regulates the map. Applying the method to the unbiased spin--boson model reveals an emergent transverse measurement primitive: bath memory and counter--rotating terms induce phase lock-in that irreversibly erases the relative phase between $σ_x$ eigenspaces on a finite timescale $t_P$, yielding an effective zero-bias transverse ($σ_x$) measurement channel. The selected transverse basis is not assumed a priori; it follows from the reconstructed reduced dynamics. The effect disappears in the rotating-wave approximation and in the Davies weak-coupling limit, demonstrating its non--Markovian interference origin."}

We present an experimental study of magic state cultivation on a superconducting quantum processor. We implement cultivation, including code-switching into a surface code, and develop a fault-tolerant measurement protocol to bound the magic state fidelity. Cultivation reduces the error by a factor of 40, with a state fidelity of 0.9999(1) (retaining 8% of attempts).

Although not a performance study, we report measurable outcomes through the successful asynchronous scheduling and execution of multiple quantum workloads. To illustrate practical runtime implications, we decompose a four-qubit circuit into smaller subcircuits through a process known as quantum circuit cutting, reducing per-task quantum simulation load and demonstrating how task granularity can improve simulator throughput and reduce queueing behavior -- effects directly relevant to early quantum hardware environments. We conclude by outlining key challenges for scaling hybrid runtimes, including coordinated scheduling, classical-quantum interaction management, and support for diverse backend resources in heterogeneous systems."}

This description is equivalent to assuming that the effective positive-operator-valued measurement (POVM) is diagonal in the measurement basis, and therefore completely insensitive to quantum coherences. We relax this assumption and derive a fully general expression for the observed measurement probabilities under arbitrary completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) noise preceding a computational-basis measurement. Writing the ideal post-circuit stat $\\tildeρ$ in terms of its populations $x$ and coherences $y$, we show that the observed probability vector $z$ satisfies $z = A x + C y$, where $A$ is the familiar classical assignment matrix and $C$ is a coherence-response matrix constructed from the off-diagonal matrix elements of the effective POVM in the computational basis. The classical model $z = A x$ arises if and only if all POVM elements are diagonal; in this sense $C$ quantifies accessible information about coherent readout distortions and interference between computational-basis states, all of which are invisible to models that retain only $A$. This work therefore provides a natural, fully general framework for coherence-sensitive readout modeling on current and future quantum devices."}

Here, we propose a low-depth quantum neural network architecture with linear scaling, inspired by memory-enabled photonic components, for variational entanglement engineering. The network incorporates physically motivated non-linear activation functions, enhancing expressivity beyond linear variational circuits at fixed depth. By Monte Carlo sampling over circuit topologies, we identify architectures that efficiently generate highly entangled pure states, approaching the GHz limit, and demonstrate a clear advantage of non-linear networks up to 20 qubits. For the noisy scenario, we employ the experimentally accessible Meyer-Wallach global entanglement as a surrogate optimization cost and certify entanglement using bipartite negativity. For mixed states of up to ten qubits, the optimized circuits generate substantial entanglement across both symmetric and asymmetric bipartitions. These results establish an experimentally motivated and scalable variational framework for engineering multipartite entanglement on near-term quantum devices, highlighting the combined role of non-linearity and circuit topology."}

Although the nuclei in these systems naturally lead to electron spin decoherence, they can be repurposed, if they are controllable, as long-lived quantum memories. Prior work showed that a metric known as the one-tangling power can be used to quantify the entanglement dynamics of sparse systems of spin-1/2 nuclei coupled to color centers in diamond and SiC. Here, we generalize these findings to a wide range of electron-nuclear central-spin systems, including those with spin > 1/2 nuclei, such as in III-V quantum dots (QDs), rare-earth ions, and some color centers. Focusing on the example of an (In)GaAs QD, we offer a procedure for pinpointing physically realistic parameter regimes that yield maximal entanglement between the central electron and surrounding nuclei. We further harness knowledge of naturally-occurring degeneracies and the tunability of the system to generate maximal entanglement between target subsets of spins when the QD electron is subject to dynamical decoupling. We also leverage the one-tangling power as an exact and immediate method for computing QD electron spin dephasing times with and without the application of spin echo sequences, and use our analysis to identify coherence-sustaining conditions within the system."}

To overcome this barrier, this paper introduces an efficient Frozen Gaussian Sampling (FGS) algorithm based on the Wigner-Fokker-Planck phase-space formulation. The proposed algorithm exhibits two transformative advantages. First, for the computation of physical observables, its sampling error is independent of the semiclassical parameter $\\varepsilon$, thus fundamentally breaking the prohibitive computational scaling faced by grid methods in the semiclassical limit. Second, its mesh-free nature entirely eliminates the boundary-induced instabilities that constrain long-time grid-based simulations. Leveraging these capabilities, the FGS algorithm serves as a powerful investigatory tool for exploring the long-time behavior of open quantum systems. Specifically, we provide compelling numerical evidence for the existence of steady states in strongly non-harmonic potentials-a regime where rigorous analytical results are currently lacking."}

In this work, we investigate a one-dimensional spin model featuring a tunable long-range hopping term, $H_{n}$, which introduces nonlocal interactions and bridges the gap between Hermitian and non-Hermitian regimes. Through a systematic analysis of level-spacing statistics, Krylov complexity, and entanglement entropy, we demonstrate that $H_{n}$ acts as a universal control parameter driving the transition from integrability to quantum chaos. Specifically, increasing the strength of $H_{n}$ induces a crossover from Poissonian to Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble statistics in the Hermitian limit, and similarly triggers chaotic dynamics in the non-Hermitian case. Most remarkably, despite the onset of global chaos, we identify a tower of exact nonthermal eigenstates that evade thermalization. These states survive as robust quantum many-body scars, retaining low entanglement and coherent dynamics even under strong non-Hermitian perturbations. Our findings reveal a universal mechanism by which long-range and non-Hermitian effects reshape quantum ergodicity, offering new pathways for preserving quantum coherence in complex many-body systems."}

It is about the decision-making behavior any individual agent should strive for, not a descriptive \"law of nature.\" Second, all probabilities, including all quantum probabilities, are so subjective they never tell nature what to do. This includes probability-1 assignments. Quantum states thus have no \"ontic hold\" on the world, which implies a more radical kind of indeterminism in quantum theory than other interpretations understand. Third, quantum measurement outcomes just are personal experiences for the agent gambling upon them. Thus all quantum measurement outcomes are local in the sense of the agent enacting them. Through these tenets, we explain four points better than previously: 1) how QBism contrasts with Bohr's concern over unambiguous language, 2) how QBism contrasts with the Everett interpretation, 3) how QBism understands the meaning of Bell inequality violations, and 4) how QBism responds to Wigner's \"suspended animation\" argument.

The $ω$ and $κ$ sweeps confirm that curvature and not the choice of control parameter determines the behaviour of the system.

Typically, the theoretical modeling has been conducted in the Schrödinger picture, where results are only obtainable under certain approximations, while, in contrast, the Heisenberg picture has remained relatively unexplored. In this work, we develop an accurately controlled perturbative expansion of the time-evolution operator in the Heisenberg picture and derive beyond-semiclassical corrections to the emitter dynamics due to the coupling to the quantized electromagnetic field, capturing effects of the quantum fluctuations present in the latter. We focus on high-order harmonic generation (HHG), where the approach is accurate in parameter regimes of current interest and it gives closed-form expressions for key observables. This formulation not only simplifies numerical calculations compared to the Schrödinger-picture approach but also provides a clear correspondence between nonclassical features of the emitted light and the underlying induced dynamics of the generating medium including quantum fluctuations. Moreover, the Heisenberg framework naturally yields scaling relations with the number of independent emitters, enabling us to assess whether nonclassical behavior should persist under typical experimental conditions involving large emitter ensembles. Interestingly, we find that the degree of squeezing increases with the number of emitters, whereas the photon statistics approaches a classical Poissonian distribution in the many-emitter limit. We also find that the beyond-semiclassical emitter dynamics significantly enhances the degree of squeezing of the emitted light. Our work advances the theoretical understanding of quantum-optical HHG and introduces an accessible and well-controlled framework to describe realistic experiments."}

A crucial component of QNNs is the encoder, which maps classical input data into quantum states. However, choosing suitable encoders remains a significant challenge, largely due to the lack of systematic guidance and the trial-and-error nature of current approaches. This process is further impeded by two key challenges: (1) the difficulty in evaluating encoded quantum states prior to training, and (2) the lack of intuitive methods for analyzing an encoder's ability to effectively distinguish data features. To address these issues, we introduce a novel visualization tool, XQAI-Eyes, which enables QNN developers to compare classical data features with their corresponding encoded quantum states and to examine the mixed quantum states across different classes. By bridging classical and quantum perspectives, XQAI-Eyes facilitates a deeper understanding of how encoders influence QNN performance. Evaluations across diverse datasets and encoder designs demonstrate XQAI-Eyes's potential to support the exploration of the relationship between encoder design and QNN effectiveness, offering a holistic and transparent approach to optimizing quantum encoders. Moreover, domain experts used XQAI-Eyes to derive two key practices for quantum encoder selection, grounded in the principles of pattern preservation and feature mapping."}

Here, we explore the DTC in a disorder-free, periodically kicked XXZ spin chain, which is stabilized by the Floquet strong Hilbert space fragmentation. We numerically show the period-doubling response of the conventional DTC order, and uncover a multiple-period response with beating dynamics due to the coherent interplay of multiple $π$-pairs in the Floquet spectrum of small-size systems. The lifetime of the DTC order exhibits independence of the driving frequency and a power-law dependence on the ZZ interaction strength. It also grows exponentially with the system size, as a hallmark of the strong fragmentation inherent to the Floquet model. We analytically reveal the approximate conservation of the magnetization and domain-wall number in the Floquet operator for the emergent strong fragmentation, which is consistent with numerical results of the dimensionality ratio of symmetry subspaces. The rigidity and phase regime of the DTC order are identified through finite-size scaling of the Floquet-spectrum-averaged mutual information, as well as via dynamical probes. Our work establishes the Floquet Hilbert space fragmentation as a disorder-free mechanism for sustaining nontrivial temporal orders in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems."}

ESMs are needed for predicting and projecting climate change, and can be improved in hybrid models incorporating both traditional physics-based components as well as machine learning (ML) models. We show that a QNN can predict cloud cover with a performance similar to a classical NN with the same number of free parameters and significantly better than the traditional scheme.

This minimum communication rate can be difficult to achieve while preserving the quality of the quantum processor. Here, we present two decoders that make use of a reduced syndrome information volume, relying on a number of syndrome bits that scale only as the width -- and not the usual area -- of the surface-code patch. This eases the communication requirements necessary for real-time decoding."}

The protocol involves creating a maximally entangled n--qubit state, encoding the classical message with Pauli--Z and Pauli--X gates, and then transmitting and decoding the message via quantum communication, quantum operations, and measurements. The key novelty of this work lies in the proposed n--bit encoding routine, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first explicit and scalable recipe for constructing quantum circuits for n--bit Superdense Coding, minimizing errors through a simple circuit design. The protocol was tested on real quantum hardware using Qiskit 2.0 and the IBM--Torino quantum computer for message lengths of 4, 6, 8, and 10 bits. Results show that success rates decrease as message length, circuit depth, and gate count increase, largely due to increased Pauli--X gate usage for messages with more ``1\" bits.

This geometric distillation establishes a precise mapping connecting external control parameters directly to optimal measurement configurations. Crucially, a comparative analysis of the geometric angles against the principal eigenvalue spectrum, including its magnitude, susceptibility, and nonlocal gap, reveals a fundamental dichotomy in quantum criticality. While transitions involving symmetry sector rotation manifest as geometric criticality with drastic operator reorientation, transitions dominated by strong anisotropy exhibit geometric locking, where the optimal basis remains robust despite clear signatures of phase transitions in the spectral indicators. This distinction offers a novel structural classification of quantum phase transitions and provides a precision navigation chart for Bell experiments."}

While the global quantum state remains coherent, the observer's local reality becomes singular and definite. This work introduces reality steering, a protocol that allows an observer to probabilistically access a different reality already supported by the initial quantum state, without reversing decoherence on the environment. The mechanism relies on locally erasing the 'which-outcome' information stored in the observer's brain. Here, 'local' means operations confined to the observer's memory, excluding the environment, which may be cosmically large. Reality steering nevertheless faces intrinsic constraints: successful navigation requires coherent participation from the observer's counterparts across the relevant branches, and any transition is operationally indistinguishable from non-transition. After arriving in a new reality, all memory records are perfectly consistent with that reality, leaving no internal evidence that a switch occurred. This makes conscious confirmation impossible within standard quantum mechanics. We show that nonlinear operations beyond the standard theory could, in principle, enable verifiable and deliberate navigation. Our results shift multi-reality exploration from philosophical speculation toward a concrete -- though fundamentally constrained -- quantum-informational framework."}

In quantum mechanics, however, where one has a high degree of control over microscopic systems, information theory plays an important role in describing the thermal properties of quantum systems. Recently, a new approach has been proposed in the form of a quantum thermodynamic gauge theory, where the notion of redundant information arises from a group of physically motivated gauge transformations called the thermodynamic group. In this work, we explore the geometrical structure of quantum thermodynamics. Particularly, we do so by explicitly constructing the relevant principal fibre bundle. We then show that there are two distinct (albeit related) geometric structures associated with the gauge theory of quantum thermodynamics. In this way, we express thermodynamics in the same mathematical (geometric) language as the fundamental theories of physics. Finally, we discuss how the geometric and topological properties of these structures may help explain fundamental properties of thermodynamics."}

Understanding the effect of hardware noise on these experiments is crucial to distinguish errors that have low impact, errors that can be mitigated, and errors that must be reduced at the hardware level. We ran a state preparation and energy measurement protocol on an ion-trap quantum computer, without any non-scalable off-loading of computational tasks to classical computers, and show that leakage errors are the main obstacle to chemical accuracy. More specifically, we apply adiabatic state preparation to prepare the ground state of a six-qubit encoding of the H3+ molecule and extract its energy using a noise-resilient variant of iterative quantum phase estimation. Our results improve upon the classical Hartree-Fock energy. Analyzing the effect of hardware noise on the result, we find that while coherent and incoherent noise have little influence, the hardware results are mainly impacted by leakage errors. Absent leakage errors, noisy numerical simulations show that with our experimental settings we would have achieved close to chemical accuracy, even shot noise included.

Two leading methods in solving the ground state problem are the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Adiabatic Quantum Computing (AQC) algorithms. VQE often struggles with convergence due to the energy landscape being highly non-convex and the existence of barren plateaux, and implementing AQC is beyond the capabilities of current quantum devices as it requires deep circuits. Adiabatically-inspired algorithms aim to fill this gap. In this paper, we first present a unifying framework for these algorithms and then benchmark the following methods: the Adiabatically Assisted VQE (AAVQE) (Garcia-Saez and Latorre (2018)), the Variational Adiabatic Quantum Computing (VAQC) (Harwood et al (2022)), and the Adiabatic Quantum Computing with Parametrized Quantum Circuits (AQC-PQC) (Kolotouros et al (2025)) algorithms. Second, we introduce a novel hybrid approach termed G-AQC-PQC, which generalizes the AQC-PQC method, and combines adiabatic-inspired initialization with the low-memory BFGS optimizer, reducing the quantum computational cost of the method. Third, we compare the accuracy of the methods for chemistry applications using the beryllium hydride molecule (BeH$_2$). We compare the approaches across a number of different choices (ansätze types, depth, discretization steps, initial Hamiltonian, adiabatic schedules and method used). Our results show that the G-AQC-PQC outperforms conventional VQE.

This scaling is directly observable in the single-photon scattering spectrum, enabling the detection of minute changes in atomic separation with a figure of merit that scales as $ N^3 $. The quantum Fisher information (QFI) scales as $N^6$ and can be closely approached by measuring spectral shifts near the steepest slope of the most subradiant resonance. These enhancements remain robust under realistic positional disorder, confirming that dipole--dipole-engineered subradiance provides a viable resource for quantum metrology.

Introducing stochastic noise reveals a strong dependence on the charging trajectory. Protocols that weakly excite the system gain energy under noise but lose extractable work.

The execution of a circuit, however, depends on internal allocation and routing policies that are not observable to the user. A provider may redirect jobs to more error-prone regions to conserve resources, balance load or for other opaque reasons, causing degradation in fidelity while still presenting stale or averaged calibration data. This lack of transparency creates a security gap: users cannot verify whether their circuits were executed on the hardware for which they were charged. Forensic methods that infer backend behavior from user-visible artifacts are therefore becoming essential. In this work, we introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based forensic framework that predicts per-qubit and per-qubit link error rates of an unseen backend using only topology information and aggregated features extracted from transpiled circuits. We construct a dataset from several IBM 27-qubit devices, merge static calibration features with dynamic transpilation features and train separate GNN regressors for one- and two-qubit errors. At inference time, the model operates without access to calibration data from the target backend and reconstructs a complete error map from the features available to the user. Our results on the target backend show accurate recovery of backend error rate, with an average mismatch of approximately 22% for single-qubit errors and 18% for qubit-link errors. The model also exhibits strong ranking agreement, with the ordering induced by predicted error values closely matching that of the actual calibration errors, as reflected by high Spearman correlation. The framework consistently identifies weak links and high-noise qubits and remains robust under realistic temporal noise drift."}

Evaluations on 2--5 qubit systems and arbitrary-dimensional states show PINN consistently outperforms traditional neural networks (TNNs), achieving highest fidelity across all dimensions. PINN outperforms baselines, with marked improvements in moderately high-dimensional systems, superior noise robustness (slower performance degradation), and consistent dimensional robustness.

Using small Ising models, we show that MCMC post-processing corrects the sampling bias of quantum dynamics and restores near-uniform sampling over degenerate ground states. We then apply the method to random $k$-SAT problems near the satisfiability threshold. For random 2-SAT, a hybrid MCMC combining QAOA-assisted neural proposals with single spin-flip updates achieves fairness comparable to that of PT-ICM. For random 3-SAT, where such classical methods are no longer applicable, the hybrid MCMC still attains approximately uniform sampling.

This forms a new type of attack on the economics of cloud-based quantum computers. All major quantum computing companies today offer access to their hardware through some type of cloud-based service. Due to the noisy nature of quantum computers, a quantum circuit is run many times to collect the output statistics, and each run is called a shot. The fees users pay for access to the machines typically depend on the number of these shots of a quantum circuit that are executed. Per-shot pricing is a clean and straightforward approach as users are charged a small fee for each shot of their circuit. This work demonstrates that per-shot pricing can be exploited to get circuits to run for free when users abuse recently implemented mid-circuit qubit measurement and reset operations. Through evaluation on real, cloud-based quantum computers this work shows how multiple circuits can be executed together within a shot, by separating each user circuit by set of reset operations and submitting all the circuits, and reset operations, as one larger circuit. As a result, the user is charged per-shot pricing, even though inside each shot are multiple circuits. Total per-shot cost to run certain circuits could be reduced by up to $900$\\% using methods proposed in this work, leading to significant financial losses to quantum computing companies. To address this novel finding, this work proposes a clear approach for how users should be charged for their execution, while maintaining the flexibility and usability of the mid-circuit measurement and reset~operations."}

In many practical schemes, the initial qubit configuration has to be inferred from readout that is a time-dependent weak measurement record. However, a combination of the measurement scheme and intrinsic dynamics can end up scrambling the initial state and lose information irretrievably. Here, we study the information physics of quantum trajectories based on weak measurements in order to address the optimal achievable performance in qubit configuration readout for two realistic models of single qubit readout: (i) Model I is informationally complete, but without intrinsic dynamics; (ii) Model II is informationally incomplete weak measurements with intrinsic dynamics. We first use mutual information to characterize how much intrinsic information about the initial state is encoded in the measurement record. Using a fixed discrete time-step formulation, we compute the mutual information while varying the measurement strength, duration of measurement record, and the relative strength of intrinsic dynamics in our measurement schemes. We also exploit the emergence of continuum scaling and the Stochastic Master Equation in the weak measurement limit. We develop an asymptotic expansion in the measurement efficiency parameter to calculate mutual information, which captures qualitative and quantitative features of the numerical data. The bounds on information extraction are manifested as plateaux in mutual information, our analysis obtains these bounds and also optimal duration of measurement required to saturate them.

Cunha", "Michael Ruggenthaler", "Johannes Flick", "Angel Rubio"], "title": "Testing electron-photon exchange-correlation functional performance for many-electron systems under weak and strong light-matter coupling", "comment": null, "summary": "We present results of a photon-free exchange-correlation functional within the local density approximation (pxcLDA) for quantum electrodynamics density functional theory (QEDFT) that efficiently describes the electron density of many-electron systems across weak to strong light-matter coupling. Building on previous work [I-Te. Lu et al., Phys. Rev. A 109, 052823 (2024)] that captured electron-photon correlations via an exchange-correlation functional derived from the nonrelativistic Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian and tested on one-electron systems, we use a simple procedure to compute a renormalization factor describing electron-photon correlations and inhomogeneity in the weak-coupling regime by comparing it with quantum electrodynamics coupled-cluster, and previous QEDFT optimized effective potential methods. Across various atoms and molecules, pxcLDA reproduces cavity-modified densities in close agreement with these references. The renormalization factor approaches unity as the system size or collective coupling increases, reflecting an electron-photon exchange-dominated behavior and improved accuracy for larger systems. This approach now offers a practical route to applying QEDFT functionals based on electron density to realistic electron systems."}

Directly probing these structures, particularly in correlated quantum systems, remains a significant experimental challenge. Here, we provide rigorous results on the structure of the many-body wavefunction and propose to use an interferometric technique to probe its zeros in ultra-cold atomic systems. Specifically, we refer to the so-called heterodyne interferometric reconstruction of the phase of the many-body wavefunction. We prove that the sought nodal surfaces show up as specific discontinuities in the interference fringes. Following Leggett, both `symmetry-dictated' nodal surfaces, due to particle statistics, and `non-symmetry dictated' nodal surfaces emerging from interaction effects, can be probed. We demonstrate how the spin degrees of freedom, effectively modifying the structure of the nodal surfaces of the many-body wavefunction, leave distinct fingerprints in the resulting interference pattern. Our work addresses important features of the structure of the many-body wavefunction that are broadly relevant for quantum science ranging from conceptual aspects to computational questions of extended systems and quantum simulation."}

[Phys. Rev. A 57, 3818 (1998)] to cases with a complex spectrum. By introducing the proper left eigenvectors associated with each regime, we construct a biorthogonal basis. While the usual Bogoliubov normalization $\\langle u | u \\rangle - \\langle v | v \\rangle = 1$ may not hold in this basis, it still allows for a complete mode decomposition and an accurate reconstruction of arbitrary perturbations over time. This approach extends the applicability of the Bogoliubov framework beyond the stable regime, providing a consistent analysis of the time evolution of unstable condensates. As a proof of concept, we apply the method to a one-dimensional condensate with attractive interactions, which is dynamically unstable and evolves into nonstationary localized structures seeded by small perturbations."}

Takács"], "title": "Quantum fields in a cold atomic simulator: relaxation and phase locking in tunnel-coupled 1D bosonic quasi-condensates", "comment": "17 pages, 9 figures", "summary": "We consider a prime example of simulating interacting relativistic QFT with cold atoms: the realisation of the sine-Gordon model by tunnel-coupled quasi-1D Bose gases. While experiments have shown that it can realise the sine-Gordon model in equilibrium, studies of non-equilibrium dynamics have revealed a phase-locking behaviour that stands in contrast to predictions from sine-Gordon field theory. Here, we examine a one-dimensional field-theoretic model of the system and find that the phase-locking behaviour can be understood in terms of the presence of the longitudinal harmonic trap, and that the additional degrees of freedom known to be present in the experiment do not appear to play a significant role. Therefore, the experimental setup provides a good simulator of the sine-Gordon quantum field theory, even out of equilibrium, if the inhomogeneous background induced by the trap is taken into account. Furthermore, our results support the idea that modifying the longitudinal trap to a box shape should result in agreement with standard sine-Gordon dynamics. The main remaining open issues are to account for 3D corrections and model the effect of the boundaries."}

This review explores their behavior across dimensions, focusing on magnetic atoms in quasi-2D in comparison to 3D. In 3D, strong DDI leads to phenomena like anisotropic superfluidity, quantum droplets stabilized by Lee-Huang-Yang corrections, and supersolid states with density modulations. In 2D, we discuss a new scenario where DDI induces angle-dependent Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions and potential supersolidity, as suggested by recent experimental realizations of strongly dipolar systems in quasi-2D geometries. We identify key challenges for future experimental and theoretical work on strongly dipolar 2D systems. The review concludes by highlighting how these unique 2D dipolar systems could advance fundamental research as well as simulate novel physical phenomena."}

We explore which parameter regimes can realistically be achieved using currently available experimental techniques, discuss how to implement these techniques, and outline which molecular species are particularly well suited to explore exotic new states of matter.

There is a significant research interest in controlling and enhancing the photonic SHE. In this paper, we theoretically investigate the microwave field control of the photonic SHE in a closed-loop $Λ$-type atomic system. We demonstrate that both the magnitude and angular position of the photonic SHE can be controlled by varying the relative phase $φ$ between the driving optical fields and the strength of the microwave coupling $Ω_μ$. At zero probe field detuning ($Δ_p = 0$) and $φ=0,π$, the photonic SHE magnitude reaches to upper limit equal to the half of the incident beam waist, and remains largely unaffected by the microwave strength $Ω_μ$, but its angular position shifts linearly with increasing $Ω_μ$. At intermediate phases, especially at $φ= π/2$, the magnitude of the photonic SHE exponentially decreases with the increase of $Ω_μ$. Interestingly, we observed microwave-controlled switching of photonic SHE by tuning the relative phase $φ$ at an optimized value of $Ω_μ$ and $Ω_{c}$. In contrast, at $Δ_p = \\pm Ω_c$, a maximum photonic SHE equal to half of the incident beam waist occurs at $φ\\leq π$ and $Ω_μ \\geq Ω_p$, where both real and imaginary parts of the susceptibility vanish, yielding a unit refractive index. Our results may have potential applications in microwave quantum sensing and quantum optical switches based on the photonic SHE."}
